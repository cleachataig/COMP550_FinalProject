But how these fond, these justifiable hopes have been answered,\\nthe following narrative will show.\\n\\nOn my return to this my native State, as soon as it was noised abroad\\nthat I had met with extraordinary adventures, and made a most wonderful\\nvoyage, crowds of people pressed eagerly to see me. I at first met their\\ninquiries with a cautious silence, which, however, but sharpened their\\ncuriosity. At length I was visited by a near relation, with whom I felt\\nless disposed to reserve. With friendly solicitude he inquired \"how much\\nI had made by my voyage;\" and when he was informed that, although I had\\nadded to my knowledge, I had not improved my fortune, he stared at me a\\nwhile, and remarking that he had business at the Bank, as well as an\\nappointment on \\'Change, suddenly took his leave. After this, I was not\\nmuch interrupted by the tribe of inquisitive idlers, but was visited\\nprincipally by a few men of science, who wished to learn what I could\\nadd to their knowledge of nature. To this class I was more communicative;\\nand when I severally informed them that I had actually been to the\\nMoon, some of them shrugged their shoulders, others laughed in my face,\\nand some were angry at my supposed attempt to deceive them; but all,\\nwith a single exception, were incredulous.\\n\\nIt was to no purpose that I appealed to my former character for veracity.\\nI was answered, that travelling had changed my morals, as it had changed\\nother people\\'s. I asked what motives I could have for attempting to\\ndeceive them. They replied, the love of distinction--the vanity of being\\nthought to have seen what had been seen by no other mortal; and they\\ntriumphantly asked me in turn, what motives Raleigh, and Riley, and\\nHunter, and a hundred other travellers, had for their misrepresentations.\\nFinding argument thus unavailing, I produced visible and tangible proofs\\nof the truth of my narrative. I showed them a specimen of moonstone.\\nThey asserted that it was of the same character as those meteoric stones\\nwhich had been found in every part of the world, and that I had merely\\nprocured a piece of one of these for the purpose of deception. I then\\nexhibited some of what I considered my most curious Lunar plants: but\\nthis made the matter worse; for it so happened, that similar ones were\\nthen cultivated in Mr. Prince\\'s garden at Flushing. I next produced\\nsome rare insects, and feathers of singular birds: but persons were\\nfound who had either seen, or read, or heard of similar insects and\\nbirds in Hoo-Choo, or Paraguay, or Prince of Wales\\'s Island. In short,\\nhaving made up their minds that what I said was not true, they had an\\nanswer ready for all that I could urge in support of my character; and\\nthose who judged most christianly, defended my veracity at the expense\\nof my understanding, and ascribed my conduct to partial insanity.\\n\\nThere was, indeed, a short suspension to this cruel distrust. An old\\nfriend coming to see me one day, and admiring a beautiful crystal which\\nI had brought from the Moon, insisted on showing it to a jeweller, who\\nsaid that it was an unusually hard stone, and that if it were a diamond,\\nit would be worth upwards of 150,000 dollars. I know not whether the\\nmistake that ensued proceeded from my friend, who is something of a wag,\\nor from one of the lads in the jeweller\\'s shop, who, hearing a part of\\nwhat his master had said, misapprehended the rest; but so it was, that\\nthe next day I had more visiters than ever, and among them my kinsman,\\nwho was kind enough to stay with me, as if he enjoyed my good fortune,\\nuntil both the Exchange and the Banks were closed. On the same day,\\nthe following paragraph appeared in one of the morning prints:\\n\\n    \"We understand that our enterprising and intelligent traveller,\\n    JOSEPH ATTERLEY, Esquire, has brought from his Lunar Expedition,\\n    a diamond of extraordinary size and lustre. Several of the most\\n    experienced jewellers of this city have estimated it at from\\n    250,000 to 300,000 dollars; and some have gone so far as to say\\n    it would be cheap at half a million. We have the authority of a\\n    near relative of that gentleman for asserting, that the satisfactory\\n    testimonials which he possesses of the correctness of his narrative,\\n    are sufficient to satisfy the most incredulous, and to silence\\n    malignity itself.\"\\n\\nBut this gleam of sunshine soon passed away. Two days afterwards, another\\nparagraph appeared in the same paper, in these words:\\n\\n    \"We are credibly informed, that the supposed diamond of the _famous_\\n    traveller to the Moon, turns out to be one of those which are found\\n    on Diamond Island, in Lake George. We have heard that Mr. A----y\\n    means to favour the public with an account of his travels, under\\n    the title of \\'Lunarian Adventures;\\' but we would take the liberty\\n    of recommending, that for _Lunarian_, he substitute _Lunatic_.\"\\n\\nThus disappointed in my expectations, and assailed in my character,\\nwhat could I do but appeal to an impartial public, by giving them a\\ncircumstantial detail of what was most memorable in my adventures, that\\nthey might judge, from intrinsic evidence, whether I was deficient either\\nin soundness of understanding or of moral principle? But let me first\\nbespeak their candour, and a salutary diffidence of themselves, by one\\nor two well-authenticated anecdotes.\\n\\nDuring the reign of Louis the XIVth, the king of Siam having received\\nan ambassador from that monarch, was accustomed to hear, with wonder\\nand delight, the foreigner\\'s descriptions of his own country: but the\\nminister having one day mentioned, that in France, water, at one time\\nof the year, became a solid substance, the Siamese prince indignantly\\nexclaimed,--\"Hold, sir! I have listened to the strange things you have\\ntold me, and have hitherto believed them all; but now when you wish to\\npersuade me that water, which I know as well as you, can become hard, I\\nsee that your purpose is to deceive me, and I do not believe a word you\\nhave uttered.\"\\n\\nBut as the present patriotic preference for home-bred manufactures, may\\nextend to anecdotes as well as to other productions, a story of domestic\\norigin may have more weight with most of my readers, than one introduced\\nfrom abroad.\\n\\nThe chief of a party of Indians, who had visited Washington during\\nMr. Jefferson\\'s presidency, having, on his return home, assembled his\\ntribe, gave them a detail of his adventures; and dwelling particularly\\nupon the courteous treatment the party had received from their \"Great\\nFather,\" stated, among other things, that he had given them ice, though\\nit was then mid-summer. His countrymen, not having the vivacity of our\\nladies, listened in silence till he had ended, when an aged chief stepped\\nforth, and remarked that he too, when a young man, had visited their\\nGreat Father Washington, in New-York, who had received him as a son, and\\ntreated him with all the delicacies that his country afforded, but had\\ngiven him no ice. \"Now,\" added the orator, \"if any man in the world could\\nhave made ice in the summer, it was Washington; and if he could have made\\nit, I am sure he would have given it to me. Tustanaggee is, therefore, a\\nliar, and not to be believed.\"\\n\\nIn both these cases, though the argument seemed fair, the conclusion was\\nfalse; for had either the king or the chief taken the trouble to satisfy\\nhimself of the fact, he might have found that his limited experience had\\ndeceived him.\\n\\nIt is unquestionably true, that if travellers sometimes impose on the\\ncredulity of mankind, they are often also not believed when they speak\\nthe truth. Credulity and scepticism are indeed but different names for\\nthe same hasty judgment on insufficient evidence: and, as the old woman\\nreadily assented that there might be \"mountains of sugar and rivers\\nof rum,\" because she had seen them both, but that there were \"fish\\nwhich could fly,\" she never would believe; so thousands give credit\\nto Redheiffer\\'s patented discovery of perpetual motion, because they\\nhad beheld his machine, and question the existence of the sea-serpent,\\nbecause they have not seen it.\\n\\nI would respectfully remind that class of my readers, who, like the\\nking, the Indian, or the old woman, refuse to credit any thing which\\ncontradicts the narrow limits of their own observation, that there are\\n\"more secrets in nature than are dreamt of in their philosophy;\" and\\nthat upon their own principles, before they have a right to condemn me,\\nthey should go or send to the mountains of Ava, for some of the metal\\nwith which I made my venturous experiment, and make one for themselves.\\n\\nAs to those who do not call in question my veracity, but only doubt my\\nsanity, I fearlessly appeal from their unkind judgment to the sober and\\nunprejudiced part of mankind, whether, what I have stated in the following\\npages, is not consonant with truth and nature, and whether they do not\\nthere see, faithfully reflected from the Moon, the errors of the learned\\non Earth, and \"the follies of the wise?\"\\n\\nJOSEPH ATTERLEY.\\n\\n_Long-Island, September_, 1827.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOYAGE TO THE MOON.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n_Atterley\\'s birth and education--He makes a voyage--Founders off the\\nBurman coast--Adventures in that Empire--Meets with a learned Brahmin\\nfrom Benares._\\n\\n\\nBeing about to give a narrative of my singular adventures to the world,\\nwhich, I foresee, will be greatly divided about their authenticity,\\nI will premise something of my early history, that those to whom I am\\nnot personally known, may be better able to ascertain what credit is\\ndue to the facts which rest only on my own assertion.\\n\\nI was born in the village of Huntingdon, on Long-Island, on the 11th day\\nof May, 1786. Joseph Atterley, my father, formerly of East Jersey, as it\\nwas once called, had settled in this place about a year before, in\\nconsequence of having married my mother, Alice Schermerhorn, the only\\ndaughter of a snug Dutch farmer in the neighbourhood. By means of the\\nportion he received with my mother, together with his own earnings,\\nhe was enabled to quit the life of a sailor, to which he had been bred,\\nand to enter into trade. After the death of his father-in-law, by whose\\nwill he received a handsome accession to his property, he sought, in the\\ncity of New-York, a theatre better suited to his enlarged capital. He\\nhere engaged in foreign trade; and, partaking of the prosperity which\\nthen attended American commerce, he gradually extended his business, and\\nfinally embarked in our new branch of traffic to the East Indies and\\nChina. He was now very generally respected, both for his wealth and fair\\ndealing; was several years a director in one of the insurance offices;\\nwas president of the society for relieving the widows and orphans of\\ndistressed seamen; and, it is said, might have been chosen alderman,\\nif he had not refused, on the ground that he did not think himself\\nqualified.\\n\\nMy father was not one of those who set little value on book learning,\\nfrom their own consciousness of not possessing it: on the contrary, he\\nwould often remark, that as he felt the want of a liberal education\\nhimself, he was determined to bestow one on me. I was accordingly, at\\nan early age, put to a grammar school of good repute in my native village,\\nthe master of which, I believe, is now a member of Congress; and, at the\\nage of seventeen, was sent to Princeton, to prepare myself for some\\nprofession. During my third year at that place, in one of my excursions\\nto Philadelphia, and for which I was always inventing pretexts, I became\\nacquainted with one of those faces and forms which, in a youth of twenty,\\nto see, admire, and love, is one and the same thing. My attentions were\\nfavourably received. I soon became desperately in love; and, in spite of\\nthe advice of my father and entreaties of my mother, who had formed other\\nschemes for me nearer home, I was married on the anniversary of my\\ntwenty-first year.\\n\\nIt was not until the first trance of bliss was over, that I began to\\nthink seriously on the course of life I was to pursue. From the time\\nthat my mind had run on love and matrimony, I had lost all relish for\\nserious study; and long before that time, I had felt a sentiment bordering\\non contempt for the pursuits of my father. Besides, he had already taken\\nmy two younger brothers into the counting-house with him. I therefore\\nprevailed on my indulgent parent, with the aid of my mother\\'s intercession,\\nto purchase for me a neat country-seat near Huntingdon, which presented a\\nbeautiful view of the Sound, and where, surrounded by the scenes of my\\nchildhood, I promised myself to realise, with my Susanna, that life of\\ntranquil felicity which fancy, warmed by love, so vividly depicts.\\n\\nIf we did not meet with all that we had expected, it was because we had\\nexpected too much. The happiest life, like the purest atmosphere, has\\nits clouds as well as its sunshine; and what is worse, we never fully\\nknow the value of the one, until we have felt the inconvenience of the\\nother. In the cultivation of my farm--in educating our children, a son\\nand two daughters, in reading, music, painting--and in occasional visits\\nto our friends in New-York and Philadelphia, seventeen years glided\\nswiftly and imperceptibly away; at the end of which time death, in\\ndepriving me of an excellent wife, made a wreck of my hopes and enjoyments.\\nFor the purpose of seeking that relief to my feelings which change of\\nplace only could afford, I determined to make a sea voyage; and, as one\\nof my father\\'s vessels was about to sail for Canton, I accordingly\\nembarked on board the well-known ship the _Two Brothers_, captain\\nThomas, and left Sandy-hook on the 5th day of June, 1822, having first\\nplaced my three children under the care of my brother William.\\n\\nI will not detain the reader with a detail of the first incidents of\\nour voyage, though they were sufficiently interesting at the time they\\noccurred, and were not wanting in the usual variety. We had, in singular\\nsuccession, dead calms and fresh breezes, stiff gales and sudden squalls;\\nsaw sharks, flying-fish, and dolphins; spoke several vessels: had a\\nvisit from Neptune when we crossed the Line, and were compelled to\\npropitiate his favour with some gallons of spirits, which he seems\\nalways to find a very agreeable change from sea water; and touched at\\nTable Bay and at Madagascar.\\n\\nOn the whole, our voyage was comparatively pleasant and prosperous, until\\nthe 24th of October; when, off the mouths of the Ganges, after a fine\\nclear autumnal day, just about sunset, a small dark speck was seen in\\nthe eastern horizon by our experienced and watchful captain, who, after\\nnoticing it for a few moments, pronounced that we should have a hurricane.\\nThe rapidity with which this speck grew into a dense cloud, and spread\\nitself in darkness over the heavens, as well as the increasing swell of\\nthe ocean before we felt the wind, soon convinced us he was right. No\\ntime was lost in lowering our topmasts, taking double reefs, and making\\nevery thing snug, to meet the fury of the tempest. I thought I had\\nalready witnessed all that was terrific on the ocean; but what I had\\nformerly seen, had been mere child\\'s play compared with this. Never can\\nI forget the impression that was made upon me by the wild uproar of the\\nelements. The smooth, long swell of the waves gradually changed into an\\nagitated frothy surface, which constant flashes of lightning presented\\nto us in all its horror; and in the mean time the wind whistled through\\nthe rigging, and the ship creaked as if she was every minute going to\\npieces.\\n\\nAbout midnight the storm was at its height, and I gave up all for lost.\\nThe wind, which first blew from the south-west, was then due south, and\\nthe sailors said it began to abate a little before day: but I saw no\\ngreat difference until about three in the afternoon; soon after which\\nthe clouds broke away, and showed us the sun setting in cloudless majesty,\\nwhile the billows still continued their stupendous rolling, but with a\\nheavy movement, as if, after such mighty efforts, they were seeking\\nrepose in the bosom of their parent ocean. It soon became almost calm;\\na light western breeze barely swelled our sails, and gently wafted us\\nto the land, which we could faintly discern to the north-east. Our ship\\nhad been so shaken in the tempest, and was so leaky, that captain Thomas\\nthought it prudent to make for the first port we could reach.\\n\\nAt dawn we found ourselves in full view of a coast, which, though not\\npersonally known to the captain, he pronounced by his charts to be a\\npart of the Burmese Empire, and in the neighbourhood of Mergui, on the\\nMartaban coast. The leak had now increased to an alarming extent, so\\nthat we found it would be impossible to carry the ship safe into port.\\nWe therefore hastily threw our clothes, papers, and eight casks of\\nsilver, into the long-boat; and before we were fifty yards from the\\nship, we saw her go down. Some of the underwriters in New York, as I\\nhave since learnt, had the conscience to contend that we left the ship\\nsooner than was necessary, and have suffered themselves to be sued for\\nthe sums they had severally insured. It was a little after midday when\\nwe reached the town, which is perched on a high bluff, overlooking\\nthe coasts, and contains about a thousand houses, built of bamboo,\\nand covered with palm leaves. Our dress, appearance, language, and\\nthe manner of our arrival, excited great surprise among the natives,\\nand the liveliest curiosity; but with these sentiments some evidently\\nmingled no very friendly feelings. The Burmese were then on the eve\\nof a rupture with the East India Company, a fact which we had not before\\nknown; and mistaking us for English, they supposed, or affected to\\nsuppose, that we belonged to a fleet which was about to invade them,\\nand that our ship had been sunk before their eyes, by the tutelar divinity\\nof the country. We were immediately carried before their governor,\\nor chief magistrate, who ordered our baggage to be searched, and finding\\nthat it consisted principally of silver, he had no doubt of our hostile\\nintentions. He therefore sent all of us, twenty-two in number, to prison,\\nseparating, however, each one from the rest. My companions were released\\nthe following spring, as I have since learnt, by the invading army of\\nGreat Britain; but it was my ill fortune (if, indeed, after what has\\nsince happened, I can so regard it) to be taken for an officer of high\\nrank, and to be sent, the third day afterwards, far into the interior,\\nthat I might be more safely kept, and either used as a hostage or offered\\nfor ransom, as circumstances should render advantageous.\\n\\nThe reader is, no doubt, aware that the Burman Empire lies beyond the\\nGanges, between the British possessions and the kingdom of Siam; and\\nthat the natives nearly assimilate with those of Hindostan, in language,\\nmanners, religion, and character, except that they are more hardy and\\nwarlike.\\n\\nI was transported very rapidly in a palanquin, (a sort of decorated\\nlitter,) carried on the shoulders of four men, who, for greater despatch,\\nwere changed every three hours. In this way I travelled thirteen days,\\nin which time we reached a little village in the mountainous district\\nbetween the Irawaddi and Saloon rivers, where I was placed under the\\ncare of an inferior magistrate, called a Mirvoon, who there exercised\\nthe chief authority.\\n\\nThis place, named Mozaun, was romantically situated in a fertile valley,\\nthat seemed to be completely shut in by the mountains. A small river,\\na branch of the Saloon, entered it from the west, and, after running\\nabout four miles in nearly a straight direction, turned suddenly round\\na steep hill to the south, and was entirely lost to view. The village\\nwas near a gap in the mountain, through which the river seemed to have\\nforced its way, and consisted of about forty or fifty huts, built of\\nthe bamboo cane and reeds. The house of my landlord was somewhat larger\\nand better than the rest. It stood on a little knoll that overlooked\\nthe village, the valley, the stream that ran through it, and commanded\\na distant view of the country beyond the gap. It was certainly a lovely\\nlittle spot, as it now appears to my imagination; but when the landscape\\nwas new to me, I was in no humour to relish its beauties, and when my\\nmind was more in a state to appreciate them, they had lost their novelty.\\n\\nMy keeper, whose name was Sing Fou, and who, from a long exercise of\\nmagisterial authority, was rough and dictatorial, behaved to me somewhat\\nharshly at first; but my patient submission so won his confidence and\\ngood will, that I soon became a great favourite; was regarded more as\\none of his family than as a prisoner, and was allowed by him every\\nindulgence consistent with my safe custody. But the difficulties in the\\nway of my escape were so great, that little restraint was imposed on\\nmy motions. The narrow defile in the gap, through which the river rushed\\nlike a torrent, was closed with a gate. The mountains, by which the\\nvalley was hemmed in, were utterly impassable, thickly set as they were\\nwith jungle, consisting of tangled brier, thorn and forest trees, of\\nwhich those who have never been in a tropical climate can form no adequate\\nidea. In some places it would be difficult to penetrate more than a\\nmile in the day; during which time the traveller would be perpetually\\ntormented by noxious insects, and in constant dread of beasts of prey.\\n\\nThe only outlet from this village was by passing down the valley along\\nthe settlements, and following the course of the stream; so that there\\nwas no other injunction laid on me, than not to extend my rambles far\\nin that direction. Sing Fou\\'s household consisted of his wife, whom I\\nrarely saw, four small children, and six servants; and here I enjoyed\\nnearly as great a portion of happiness as in any part of my life.\\n\\nIt had been one of my favourite amusements to ramble towards a part of\\nthe western ridge, which rose in a cone about a mile and a half from the\\nvillage, and there ascending to some comparatively level spot, or point\\nprojecting from its side, enjoy the beautiful scenery which lay before\\nme, and the evening breeze, which has such a delicious freshness in a\\ntropical climate.\\n\\nNor was this all. In a deep sequestered nook, formed by two spurs of this\\nmountain, there lived a venerable Hindoo, whom the people of the village\\ncalled the Holy Hermit. The favourable accounts I received of his\\ncharacter, as well as his odd course of life, made me very desirous\\nof becoming acquainted with him; and, as he was often visited by the\\nvillagers, I found no difficulty in getting a conductor to his cell. His\\ncharacter for sanctity, together with a venerable beard, might have\\ndiscouraged advances towards an acquaintance, if his lively piercing eye,\\na countenance expressive of great mildness and kindness of disposition,\\nand his courteous manners, had not yet more strongly invited it. He was\\nindeed not averse to society, though he had seemed thus to fly from it;\\nand was so great a favourite with his neighbours, that his cell would\\nhave been thronged with visitors, but for the difficulty of the approach\\nto it. As it was, it was seldom resorted to, except for the purpose of\\nobtaining his opinion and counsel on all the serious concerns of his\\nneighbours. He prescribed for the sick, and often provided the medicine\\nthey required--expounded the law--adjusted disputes--made all their little\\narithmetical calculations--gave them moral instruction--and, when he\\ncould not afford them relief in their difficulties, he taught them\\npatience, and gave them consolation. He, in short, united, for the simple\\npeople by whom he was surrounded, the functions of lawyer, physician,\\nschoolmaster, and divine, and richly merited the reverential respect in\\nwhich they held him, as well as their little presents of eggs, fruit, and\\ngarden stuff.\\n\\nFrom the first evening that I joined the party which I saw clambering up\\nthe path that led to the Hermit\\'s cell, I found myself strongly attached\\nto this venerable man, and the more so, from the mystery which hung\\naround his history. It was agreed that he was not a Burmese. None deemed\\nto know certainly where he was born, or why he came thither. His own\\naccount was, that he had devoted himself to the service of God, and in\\nhis pilgrimage over the east, had selected this as a spot particularly\\nfavourable to the life of quiet and seclusion he wished to lead.\\n\\nThere was one part of his story to which I could scarcely give credit.\\nIt was said that in the twelve or fifteen years he had resided in this\\nplace, he had been occasionally invisible for months together, and no\\none could tell why he disappeared, or whither he had gone. At these\\ntimes his cell was closed; and although none ventured to force their\\nway into it, those who were the most prying could hear no sound indicating\\nthat he was within. Various were the conjectures formed on the subject.\\nSome supposed that he withdrew from the sight of men for the purpose\\nof more fervent prayer and more holy meditation; others, that he visited\\nhis home, or some other distant country. The more superstitious believed\\nthat he had, by a kind of metempsychosis, taken a new shape, which, by\\nsome magical or supernatural power, he could assume and put off at\\npleasure. This opinion was perhaps the most prevalent, as it gained a\\ncolour with these simple people, from the chemical and astronomical\\ninstruments he possessed. In these he evidently took great pleasure,\\nand by their means he acquired some of the knowledge by which he so\\noften excited their admiration.\\n\\nHe soon distinguished me from the rest of his visitors, by addressing\\nquestions to me relative to my history and adventures; and I, in turn,\\nwas gratified to have met with one who took an interest in my concerns,\\nand who alone, of all I had here met with, could either enter into my\\nfeelings or comprehend my opinions. Our conversations were carried on\\nin English, which he spoke with facility and correctness. We soon found\\nourselves so much to each other\\'s taste, that there was seldom an evening\\nthat I did not make him a visit, and pass an hour or two in his company.\\n\\nI learnt from him that he was born and bred at Benares, in Hindostan;\\nthat he had been intended for the priesthood, and had been well instructed\\nin the literature of the east. That a course of untoward circumstances,\\nupon which he seemed unwilling to dwell, had changed his destination,\\nand made him a wanderer on the face of the earth. That in the neighbouring\\nkingdom of Siam he had formed an intimacy with a learned French Jesuit,\\nwho had not only taught him his language, but imparted to him a knowledge\\nof much of the science of Europe, its institutions and manners. That after\\nthe death of this friend, he had renewed his wanderings; and having been\\ndetained in this village by a fit of sickness for some weeks, he was\\nwarned that it was time to quit his rambling life. This place being\\nrecommended to him, both by its quiet seclusion, and the unsophisticated\\nmanners of its inhabitants, he determined to pass the remnant of his days\\nhere, and, by devoting them to the purposes of piety, charity, and\\nscience, to discharge his duty to his Creator, his species, and himself;\\n\"for the love of knowledge,\" he added, \"has long been my chief source of\\nselfish enjoyment.\"\\n\\nOur tastes and sentiments accorded in so many points, that our acquaintance\\nripened by degrees into the closest friendship. We were both\\nstrangers--both unfortunate; and were the only individuals here who had any\\nknowledge of letters, or of distant parts of the world. These are, indeed,\\nthe main springs of that sympathy, without which there is no love among\\nmen. It is being overwise, to treat with contempt what mankind hold in\\nrespect: and philosophy teaches us not to extinguish our feelings, but to\\ncorrect and refine them. My visits to the hermitage were frequently renewed\\nat first, because they afforded me the relief of variety, whilst his\\nintimate knowledge of men and things--his remarkable sagacity and good\\nsense--his air of mingled piety and benignity,--cheated me into\\nforgetfulness of my situation. As these gradually yielded to the lenitive\\npower of time, I sought his conversation for the positive pleasure it\\nafforded, and at last it became the chief source of my happiness. Day after\\nday, and month after month, glided on in this gentle, unvarying current,\\nfor more than three years; during which period he had occasionally thrown\\nout dark hints that the time would come when I should be restored to\\nliberty, and that he had an important secret, which he would one day\\ncommunicate. I should have been more tantalized with the expectations that\\nthese remarks were calculated to raise, had I not suspected them to be a\\ngood-natured artifice, to save me from despondency, as they were never made\\nexcept when he saw me looking serious and thoughtful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n_The Brahmin\\'s illness--He reveals an important secret to Atterley--\\nCurious information concerning the Moon--The Glonglims--They plan a\\nvoyage to the Moon._\\n\\n\\nAbout this period, one afternoon in the month of March, when I repaired\\nto the hermitage as usual, I found my venerable friend stretched on his\\nhumble pallet, breathing very quickly, and seemingly in great pain. He\\nwas labouring under a pleurisy, which is not unfrequent in the mountainous\\nregion, at this season. He told me that his disease had not yielded to\\nthe ordinary remedies which he had tried when he first felt its approach,\\nand that he considered himself to be dangerously ill. \"I am, however,\"\\nhe added, \"prepared to die. Sit down on that block, and listen to what\\nI shall say to you. Though I shall quit this state of being for another\\nand a better, I confess that I was alarmed at the thought of expiring,\\nbefore I had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with you. I am the\\ndepository of a secret, that I believe is known to no other living mortal.\\nI once determined that it should die with me; and had I not met with you,\\nit certainly should. But from our first acquaintance, my heart has been\\nstrongly attracted towards you; and as soon as I found you possessed\\nof qualities to inspire esteem as well as regard, I felt disposed to\\ngive you this proof of my confidence. Still I hesitated. I first wished\\nto deliberate on the probable effects of my disclosure upon the condition\\nof society. I saw that it might produce evil, as well as good; but on\\nweighing the two together, I have satisfied myself that the good will\\npreponderate, and have determined to act accordingly. Take this key,\\n(stretching out his feverish hand,) and after waiting two hours, in\\nwhich time the medicine I have taken will have either produced a good\\neffect, or put an end to my sufferings, you may then open that blue\\nchest in the corner. It has a false bottom. On removing the paper which\\ncovers it, you will find the manuscript containing the important secret,\\ntogether with some gold pieces, which I have saved for the day of\\nneed--because--(and he smiled in spite of his sufferings)--because\\nhoarding is one of the pleasures of old men. Take them both, and use\\nthem discreetly. When I am gone, I request you, my friend, to discharge\\nthe last sad duties of humanity, and to see me buried according to the\\nusages of my caste. The simple beings around me will then behold that\\nI am mortal like themselves. And let this precious relic of female\\nloveliness and worth, (taking a small picture, set in gold, from his\\nbosom,) be buried with me. It has been warmed by my heart\\'s blood for\\ntwenty-five years: let it be still near that heart when it ceases\\nto beat. I have yet more to say to you; but my strength is too much\\nexhausted.\"\\n\\nThe good old man here closed his eyes, with an expression of patient\\nresignation, and rather as if he courted sleep than felt inclined to it:\\nand, after shutting the door of his cell, I repaired to his little\\ngarden, to pass the allotted two hours. Left to my meditations, when\\nI thought that I was probably about to be deprived for ever of the\\nHermit\\'s conversation and society, I felt the wretchedness of my situation\\nrecur with all its former force. I sat down on a smooth rock under a\\ntamarind tree, the scene of many an interesting conference between the\\nBrahmin and myself; and I cast my eyes around--but how changed was every\\nthing before me! I no longer regarded the sparkling eddies of the little\\ncascade which fell down a steep rock at the upper end of the garden, and\\nformed a pellucid basin below. The gay flowers and rich foliage of this\\ngenial climate--the bright plumage and cheerful notes of the birds--were\\nall there; but my mind was not in a state to relish them. I arose, and in\\nextreme agitation rambled over this little Eden, in which I had passed so\\nmany delightful hours.\\n\\nBefore the allotted time had elapsed--shall I confess it?--my fears for\\nthe Hermit were overcome by those that were purely selfish. It occurred\\nto me, if he should thus suddenly die, and I be found alone in his cell,\\nI might be charged with being his murderer; and my courage, which, from\\nlong inaction, had sadly declined of late, deserted me at the thought.\\nAfter the most torturing suspense, the dial at length showed me that the\\ntwo hours had elapsed, and I hastened to the cell.\\n\\nI paused a moment at the door, afraid to enter, or even look in; made one\\nor two steps, and hearing no sound, concluded that all was over with the\\nHermit, and that my own doom was sealed. My delight was inexpressible,\\ntherefore, when I perceived that he still breathed, and when, on drawing\\nnearer, I found that he slept soundly. In a moment I passed from misery\\nto bliss. I seated myself by his side, and there remained for more than\\nan hour, enjoying the transition of my feelings. At length he awoke, and\\ncasting on me a look of placid benignity, said,--\"Atterley, my time is\\nnot yet come. Though resigned to death, I am content to live. The worst\\nis over. I am already almost restored to health.\" I then administered to\\nhim some refreshments, and, after a while, left him to repose. On again\\nrepairing to the garden, every object assumed its wonted appearance. The\\nfragrance of the orange and the jasmine was no longer lost to me. The\\nhumming birds, which swarmed round the flowering cytisus and the beautiful\\nwater-fall, once more delighted the eye and the ear. I took my usual\\nbath, as the sun was sinking below the mountain; and, finding the Hermit\\nstill soundly sleeping, I threw myself on a seat, under the shelter of\\nsome bamboos, fell asleep, and did not awake until late the next morning.\\n\\nWhen I arose, I found the good Brahmin up, and, though much weakened by\\nhis disease, able to walk about. He told me that the Mirvoon, uneasy at\\nmy not returning as usual in the evening, had sent in search of me, and\\nthat the servant, finding me safe, was content to return without me. He\\nadvised me, however, not to repeat the same cause of alarm. Sing Fou, on\\nhearing my explanation, readily forgave me for the uneasiness I had\\ncaused him. After a few days, the Brahmin recovered his ordinary health\\nand strength; and having attended him at an earlier hour than usual,\\naccording to his request on the previous evening, he thus addressed\\nme:--\\n\\n\"I have already told you, my dear Atterley, that I was born and educated\\nat Benares, and that science is there more thoroughly understood and\\ntaught than the people of the west are aware of. We have, for many\\nthousands of years, been good astronomers, chymists, mathematicians, and\\nphilosophers. We had discovered the secret of gunpowder, the magnetic\\nattraction, the properties of electricity, long before they were heard of\\nin Europe. We know more than we have revealed; and much of our knowledge\\nis deposited in the archives of the caste to which I belong; but, for\\nwant of a language generally understood and easily learnt, (for these\\nrecords are always written in the Sanscrit, that is no longer a spoken\\nlanguage,) and the diffusion which is given by the art of printing,\\nthese secrets of science are communicated only to a few, and sometimes\\neven sleep with their authors, until a subsequent discovery, under more\\nfavourable circumstances, brings them again to light.\\n\\n\"It was at this seat of science that I learnt, from one of our sages,\\nthe physical truth which I am now about to communicate, and which he\\ndiscovered, partly by his researches into the writings of ancient Pundits,\\nand partly by his own extraordinary sagacity. There is a principle of\\nrepulsion as well as gravitation in the earth. It causes fire to rise\\nupwards. It is exhibited in electricity. It occasions water-spouts,\\nvolcanoes, and earthquakes. After much labour and research, this principle\\nhas been found embodied in a metallic substance, which is met with in the\\nmountain in which we are, united with a very heavy earth; and this\\ncircumstance had great influence in inducing me to settle myself here.\\n\\n\"This metal, when separated and purified, has as great a tendency to\\nfly off from the earth, as a piece of gold or lead has to approach it.\\nAfter making a number of curious experiments with it, we bethought\\nourselves of putting it to some use, and soon contrived, with the aid\\nof it, to make cars and ascend into the air. We were very secret in\\nthese operations; for our unhappy country having then recently fallen\\nunder the subjection of the British nation, we apprehended that if we\\ndivulged our arcanum, they would not only fly away with all our treasures,\\nwhether found in palace or pagoda, but also carry off the inhabitants,\\nto make them slaves in their colonies, as their government had not then\\nabolished the African slave trade.\\n\\n\"After various trials and many successive improvements, in which our\\ndesires increased with our success, we determined to penetrate the\\naerial void as far as we could, providing for that purpose an apparatus,\\nwith which you will become better acquainted hereafter. In the course\\nof our experiments, we discovered that this same metal, which was repelled\\nfrom the earth, was in the same degree attracted towards the moon; for in\\none of our excursions, still aiming to ascend higher than we had ever\\ndone before, we were actually carried to that satellite; and if we had\\nnot there fallen into a lake, and our machine had not been water-tight,\\nwe must have been dashed to pieces or drowned. You will find in this\\nbook,\" he added, presenting me with a small volume, bound in green\\nparchment, and fastened with silver clasps, \"a minute detail of the\\napparatus to be provided, and the directions to be pursued in making\\nthis wonderful voyage. I have written it since I satisfied my mind that\\nmy fears of British rapacity were unfounded, and that I should do more\\ngood than harm by publishing the secret. But still I am not sure,\"\\nhe added, with one of his faint but significant smiles, \"that I am\\nnot actuated by a wish to immortalize my name; for where is the mortal\\nwho would be indifferent to this object, if he thought he could attain it?\\nRead the book at your leisure, and study it.\"\\n\\nI listened to this recital with astonishment; and doubted at first,\\nwhether the Brahmin\\'s late severe attack had not had the effect of\\nunsettling his brain: but on looking in his face, the calm self-possession\\nand intelligence which it exhibited, dispelled the momentary impression.\\nI was all impatience to know the adventures he met with in the moon,\\nasking him fifty questions in a breath, but was most anxious to learn\\nif it had inhabitants, and what sort of beings they were.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"the moon has inhabitants, pretty much the same as the\\nearth, of which they believe their globe to have been formerly a part.\\nBut suspend your questions, and let me give you a recital of the most\\nremarkable things I saw there.\"\\n\\nI checked my impatience, and listened with all my ears to the wonders\\nhe related. He went on to inform me that the inhabitants of the moon\\nresembled those of the earth, in form, stature, features, and manners,\\nand were evidently of the same species, as they did not differ more than\\ndid the Hottentot from the Parisian. That they had similar passions,\\npropensities, and pursuits, but differed greatly in manners and habits.\\nThey had more activity, but less strength: they were feebler in mind as\\nwell as body. But the most curious part of his information was, that a\\nlarge number of them were born without any intellectual vigour, and\\nwandered about as so many automatons, under the care of the government,\\nuntil they were illuminated with the mental ray from some earthly brains,\\nby means of the mysterious influence which the moon is known to exercise\\non our planet. But in this case the inhabitant of the earth loses what\\nthe inhabitant of the moon gains--the ordinary portion of understanding\\nallotted to one mortal being thus divided between two; and, as might be\\nexpected, seeing that the two minds were originally the same, there is a\\nmost exact conformity between the man of the earth and his counterpart in\\nthe moon, in all their principles of action and modes of thinking.\\n\\nThese Glonglims, as they are called, after they have been thus imbued\\nwith intellect, are held in peculiar respect by the vulgar, and are\\nthought to be in every way superior to those whose understandings are\\nentire. The laws by which two objects, so far apart, operate on each\\nother, have been, as yet, but imperfectly developed, and the wilder\\ntheir freaks, the more they are the objects of wonder and admiration.\\n\"The science of _lunarology_,\" he observed, \"is yet in its infancy.\\nBut in the three voyages I have made to the moon, I have acquired so\\nmany new facts, and imparted so many to the learned men of that planet,\\nthat it is, without doubt, the subject of their active speculations\\nat this time, and will, probably, assume a regular form long before the\\nnew science of phrenology of which you tell me, and which it must, in\\ntime, supersede. Now and then, though very rarely, the man of the earth\\nregains the intellect he has lost; in which case his lunar counterpart\\nreturns to his former state of imbecility. Both parties are entirely\\nunconscious of the change--one, of what he has lost, and the other of\\nwhat he has gained.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin then added: \"Though our party are the only voyagers of which\\nauthentic history affords any testimony, yet it is probable, from obscure\\nhints in some of our most ancient writings in the Sanscrit, that the\\nvoyage has been made in remote periods of antiquity; and the Lunarians\\nhave a similar tradition. While, in the revolutions which have so changed\\nthe affairs of mankind on our globe, (and probably in its satellite,)\\nthe art has been lost, faint traces of its existence may be perceived\\nin the opinions of the vulgar, and in many of their ordinary forms of\\nexpression. Thus it is generally believed throughout all Asia, that the\\nmoon has an influence on the brain; and when a man is of insane mind, we\\ncall him a lunatic. One of the curses of the common people is, \\'May the\\nmoon eat up your brains;\\' and in China they say of a man who has done\\nany act of egregious folly, \\'He was gathering wool in the moon.\\'\"\\n\\nI was struck with these remarks, and told the Hermit that the language\\nof Europe afforded the same indirect evidence of the fact he mentioned:\\nthat my own language especially, abounded with expressions which could\\nbe explained on no other hypothesis;--for, besides the terms \"lunacy,\"\\n\"lunatic,\" and the supposed influence of the moon on the brain, when we\\nsee symptoms of a disordered intellect, we say the mind _wanders_,\\nwhich evidently alludes to a part of it rambling to a distant region, as\\nis the moon. We say too, a man is \"_out of his head_,\" that is, his\\nmind being in another man\\'s head, must of course be out of his own.\\nTo \"know no more than the man in the moon,\" is a proverbial expression\\nfor ignorance, and is without meaning, unless it be considered to refer\\nto the Glonglims. We say that an insane man is \"distracted;\" by which we\\nmean that his mind is drawn two different ways. So also, we call a\\nlunatic _a man beside himself_, which most distinctly expresses the two\\ndistinct bodies his mind now animates. There are, moreover, many other\\nanalogous expressions, as \"moonstruck,\" \"deranged,\" \"extravagant,\" and\\nsome others, which, altogether, form a mass of concurring testimony that\\nit is impossible to resist.\\n\\n\"Be that as it may,\" said he, \"whether the voyage has been made in former\\ntimes or not, is of little importance: it is sufficient for us to know\\nthat it has been effected in our time, and can be effected again. I am\\nanxious to repeat the voyage, for the purpose of ascertaining some facts,\\nabout which I have been lately speculating; and I wish, besides, to\\nafford you ocular demonstration of the wonders I have disclosed; for,\\nin spite of your good opinion of my veracity, I have sometimes perceived\\nsymptoms of incredulity about you, and I do not wonder at it.\"\\n\\nThe love of the marvellous, and the wish for a change, which had long\\nslumbered in my bosom, were now suddenly awakened, and I eagerly caught\\nat his proposal.\\n\\n\"When can we set out, father?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not so fast,\" replied he; \"we have a great deal of preparation to make.\\nOur apparatus requires the best workmanship, and we cannot here command\\neither first-rate articles or materials, without incurring the risk of\\nsuspicion and interruption. While most of the simple villagers are\\nkindly disposed towards me, there are a few who regard me with distrust\\nand malevolence, and would readily avail themselves of an opportunity\\nto bring me under the censure of the priesthood and the government.\\nBesides, the governor of Mergui would probably be glad to lay hold of\\nany plausible evidence against you, as affording him the best chance of\\navoiding any future reckoning either with you or his superiors. We must\\ntherefore be very secret in our plans. I know an ingenious artificer\\nin copper and other metals, whose only child I was instrumental in curing\\nof scrofula, and in whose fidelity, as well as good will, I can safely\\nrely. But we must give him time. He can construct our machine at home,\\nand we must take our departure from that place in the night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n_The Brahmin and Atterley prepare for their voyage--Description of their\\nmachine--Incidents of the voyage--The appearance of the earth; Africa;\\nGreece--The Brahmin\\'s speculations on the different races of men--National\\ncharacter._\\n\\n\\nHaving thus formed our plan of operations, we the next day proceeded to\\nput them in execution. The coppersmith agreed to undertake the work\\nwe wanted done, for a moderate compensation; but we did not think it\\nprudent to inform him of our object, which he supposed was to make some\\nphilosophical experiment. It was forthwith arranged that he should\\noccasionally visit the Hermit, to receive instructions, as if for the\\npurpose of asking medical advice. During this interval my mind was\\nabsorbed with our project; and when in company, I was so thoughtful\\nand abstracted, that it has since seemed strange to me that Sing Fou\\'s\\nsuspicions that I was planning my escape were not more excited. At\\nlength, by dint of great exertion, in about three months every thing\\nwas in readiness, and we determined on the following night to set out\\non our perilous expedition.\\n\\nThe machine in which we proposed to embark, was a copper vessel, that\\nwould have been an exact cube of six feet, if the corners and edges\\nhad not been rounded off. It had an opening large enough to receive\\nour bodies, which was closed by double sliding pannels, with quilted\\ncloth between them. When these were properly adjusted, the machine\\nwas perfectly air-tight, and strong enough, by means of iron bars running\\nalternately inside and out, to resist the pressure of the atmosphere,\\nwhen the machine should be exhausted of its air, as we took the precaution\\nto prove by the aid of an air-pump. On the top of the copper chest\\nand on the outside, we had as much of the lunar metal (which I shall\\nhenceforth call _lunarium_) as we found, by calculation and experiment,\\nwould overcome the weight of the machine, as well as its contents,\\nand take us to the moon on the third day. As the air which the machine\\ncontained, would not be sufficient for our respiration more than about\\nsix hours, and the chief part of the space we were to pass through was\\na mere void, we provided ourselves with a sufficient supply, by condensing\\nit in a small globular vessel, made partly of iron and partly of lunarium,\\nto take off its weight. On my return, I gave Mr. Jacob Perkins, who\\nis now in England, a hint of this plan of condensation, and it has\\nthere obtained him great celebrity. This fact I should not have thought\\nit worth while to mention, had he not taken the sole merit of the\\ninvention to himself; at least I cannot hear that in his numerous public\\nnotices he has ever mentioned my name.\\n\\nBut to return. A small circular window, made of a single piece of thick\\nclear glass, was neatly fitted on each of the six sides. Several pieces\\nof lead were securely fastened to screws which passed through the bottom\\nof the machine; as well as a thick plank. The screws were so contrived,\\nthat by turning them in one direction, the pieces of lead attached\\nto them were immediately disengaged from the hooks with which they\\nwere connected. The pieces of lunarium were fastened in like manner\\nto screws, which passed through the top of the machine; so that by\\nturning them in one direction, those metallic pieces would fly into\\nthe air with the velocity of a rocket. The Brahmin took with him a\\nthermometer, two telescopes, one of which projected through the top\\nof the machine, and the other through the bottom; a phosphoric lamp,\\npen, ink, and paper, and some light refreshments sufficient to supply\\nus for some days.\\n\\nThe moon was then in her third quarter, and near the zenith: it was, of\\ncourse, a little after midnight, and when the coppersmith and his family\\nwere in their soundest sleep, that we entered the machine. In about an hour\\nmore we had the doors secured, and every thing arranged in its place, when,\\ncutting the cords which fastened us to the ground, by means of small steel\\nblades which worked in the ends of other screws, we rose from the earth\\nwith a whizzing sound, and a sensation at first of very rapid ascent: but\\nafter a short time, we were scarcely sensible of any motion in the machine,\\nexcept when we changed our places.\\n\\nThe ardent curiosity I had felt to behold the wonderful things which the\\nBrahmin related, and the hope of returning soon to my children and native\\ncountry, had made me most impatient for the moment of departure; during\\nwhich time the hazards and difficulties of the voyage were entirely\\noverlooked: but now that the moment of execution had arrived, and I found\\nmyself shut up in this small chest, and about to enter on a voyage so new,\\nso strange, and beset with such a variety of dangers, I will not deny that\\nmy courage failed me, and I would gladly have compromised to return to\\nMozaun, and remain there quietly all the rest of my days. But shame\\nrestrained me, and I dissembled my emotions.\\n\\nAt our first shock on leaving the earth, my fears were at their height; but\\nafter about two hours, I had tolerably well regained my composure, to which\\nthe returning light of day greatly contributed. By this time we had a full\\nview of the rising sun, pouring a flood of light over one half of the\\ncircular landscape below us, and leaving the rest in shade. While those\\nnatural objects, the rivers and mountains, land and sea, were fast receding\\nfrom our view, our horizon kept gradually extending as we mounted: but ere\\n10 o\\'clock this effect ceased, and the broad disc of the earth began\\nsensibly to diminish.\\n\\nIt is impossible to describe my sensations of mingled awe and admiration at\\nthe splendid spectacle beneath me, so long as the different portions of the\\nearth\\'s surface were plainly distinguishable. The novelty of the situation\\nin which I found myself, as well as its danger, prevented me indeed at\\nfirst from giving more than a passing attention to the magnificent scene;\\nbut after a while, encouraged by the Brahmin\\'s exhortation, and yet more by\\nthe example of his calm and assured air, I was able to take a more\\nleisurely view of it. At first, as we partook of the diurnal motion of the\\nearth, and our course was consequently oblique, the same portion of the\\nglobe from which we had set out, continued directly under us; and as the\\neye stretched in every direction over Asia and its seas, continents and\\nislands, they appeared like pieces of green velvet, the surrounding ocean\\nlike a mirror, and the Ganges, the Hoogley, and the great rivers of China,\\nlike threads of silver.\\n\\nAbout 11 o\\'clock it was necessary to get a fresh supply of air, when\\nmy companion cautiously turned one of the two stop-cocks to let out\\nthat which was no longer fit for respiration, requesting me, at the\\nsame time, to turn the other, to let in a fresh supply of condensed\\nair; but being awkward in the first attempt to follow his directions,\\nI was so affected by the exhaustion of the air through the vent now\\nmade for it, that I fainted; and having, at the same time, given freer\\npassage to the condensed air than I ought, we must in a few seconds\\nhave lost our supply, and thus have inevitably perished, had not the\\nwatchful Hermit seen the mischief, and repaired it almost as soon as\\nit occurred. This accident, and the various agitations my mind had\\nundergone in the course of the day, so overpowered me, that at an early\\nhour in the afternoon I fell into a profound sleep, and did not awake\\nagain for eight hours.\\n\\nWhile I slept, the good Brahmin had contrived to manage both stop-cocks\\nhimself. The time of my waking would have been about 11 o\\'clock at night,\\nif we had continued on the earth; but we were now in a region where there\\nwas no alternation of day and night, but one unvarying cloudless sun. Its\\nheat, however, was not in proportion to its brightness; for we found that\\nafter we had ascended a few miles from the earth, it was becoming much\\ncolder, and the Brahmin had recourse to a chemical process for evolving\\nheat, which soon made us comfortable: but after we were fairly in the great\\naerial void, the temperature of our machine showed no tendency to change.\\n\\nThe sensations caused by the novelty of my situation, at first checked\\nthose lively and varied trains of thought which the bird\\'s-eye view of so\\nmany countries passing in review before us, was calculated to excite: yet,\\nafter I had become more familiar with it, I contemplated the beautiful\\nexhibition with inexpressible delight. Besides, a glass of cordial, as well\\nas the calm, confiding air of the Brahmin, contributed to restore me to my\\nself-possession. The reader will recollect, that although our motion, at\\nfirst, partook of that of the earth\\'s on its axis, and although the\\n_positive_ effect was the same on our course, the _relative_ effect was\\nless and less as we ascended, and consequently, that after a certain\\nheight, every part of the terraqueous globe would present itself to our\\nview in succession, as we rapidly receded from it. At 9 o\\'clock, the whole\\nof India was a little to the west of us, and we saw, as in a map, that\\nfertile and populous region, which has been so strangely reduced to\\nsubjection, by a company of merchants belonging to a country on the\\nopposite side of the globe--a country not equal to one-fourth of it, in\\nextent or population. Its rivers were like small filaments of silver; the\\nRed Sea resembled a narrow plate of the same metal. The peninsula of India\\nwas of a darker, and Arabia of a light and more grayish green.\\n\\nThe sun\\'s rays striking obliquely on the Atlantic, emitted an effulgence\\nthat was dazzling to the eyes. For two or three hours the appearance\\nof the earth did not greatly vary, the wider extent of surface we could\\nsurvey, compensating for our greater distance; and indeed at that time\\nwe could not see the whole horizon, without putting our eyes close to\\nthe glass.\\n\\nWhen the Brahmin saw that I had overcome my first surprise, and had\\nacquired somewhat of his own composure, he manifested a disposition\\nto beguile the time with conversation. \"Look through the telescope,\"\\nsaid he, \"a little from the sun, and observe the continent of Africa,\\nwhich is presenting itself to our view.\" I took a hasty glance over\\nit, and perceived that its northern edge was fringed with green; then\\na dull white belt marked the great Sahara, or Desert, and then it exhibited\\na deep green again, to its most southern extremity. I tried in vain\\nto discover the pyramids, for our telescope had not sufficient power\\nto show them.\\n\\nI observed to him, that less was known of this continent than of the\\nothers: that a spirit of lively curiosity had been excited by the\\nwestern nations of Europe, to become acquainted with the inhabited\\nparts of the globe; but that all the efforts yet made, had still left\\na large portion almost entirely unknown. I asked if he did not think it\\nprobable that some of the nations in the interior of Africa were more\\nadvanced in civilization than those on the coast, whose barbarous custom\\nof making slaves of their prisoners, Europeans had encouraged and\\nperpetuated, by purchasing them.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said he; \"the benefits of civilization could not have been so\\neasily confined, but would have spread themselves over every part of that\\ncontinent, or at least as far as the Great Desert, if they had ever\\nexisted. The intense heat of a climate, lying on each side of the Line,\\nat once disinclines men to exertion, and renders it unnecessary. Vegetable\\ndiet is more suited to them than animal, which favours a denser population.\\nTalent is elicited by the efforts required to overcome difficulties\\nand hardships; and their natural birth-place is a country of frost and\\nsnow--of tempests--of sterility enough to give a spur to exertion, but\\nnot enough to extinguish hope. Where these difficulties exist, and give\\noccasion to war and emulation, the powers of the human mind are most\\nfrequently developed.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think then,\" said I, \"that there is no such thing as natural\\ninferiority and differences of races?\"\\n\\n\"I have been much perplexed by that question,\" said he. \"When I regard\\nthe great masses of mankind, I think there seems to be among them some\\ncharacteristic differences. I see that the Europeans have every where\\nobtained the ascendancy over those who inhabit the other quarters of\\nthe globe. But when I compare individuals, I see always the same passions,\\nthe same motives, the same mental operations; and my opinion is changed.\\nThe same seed becomes a very different plant when sowed in one soil or\\nanother, and put under this or that mode of cultivation.\"\\n\\n\"And may not,\" said I, \"the very nature of the plant be changed, after a\\nlong continuance of the same culture in the same soil?\"\\n\\n\"Why, that is but another mode of stating the question. I rather think,\\nif it has generally degenerated, it may, by opposite treatment, be also\\ngradually brought back to its original excellence.\"\\n\\n\"Who knows, then,\" said I, \"what our missionaries and colonization\\nsocieties may effect in Africa.\"\\n\\nHe inquired of me what these societies were; and on explaining their\\nhistory, observed: \"By what you tell me, it is indeed a small beginning;\\nbut if they can get this grain of mustard-seed to grow, there is no\\nsaying how much it may multiply. See what a handful of colonists have\\ndone in your own country. A few ship-loads of English have overspread\\nhalf a continent; and, from what you tell me, their descendants will\\namount, in another century, to more than one hundred millions. There is\\nno rule,\" he continued, \"that can be laid down on this subject, to which\\nsome nations cannot be found to furnish a striking exception. If mere\\ndifficulties were all that were wanting to call forth the intellectual\\nenergies of man, they have their full share on the borders of the Great\\nDesert. There are in that whitish tract which separates the countries\\non the southern shores of the Mediterranean from the rest of Africa,\\nthousands of human beings at this moment toiling over that dreary ocean\\nof sand, to whom a draught of fresh water would be a blessing, and the\\nsimplest meal a luxury.\\n\\n\"Perhaps, however, you will say they are so engrossed with the animal\\nwants of hunger and thirst, that they are incapable of attending to any\\nthing else. Be it so. But in the interior they are placed in parallel\\ncircumstances with the natives of Europe: they are engaged in struggles\\nfor territory and dominion--for their altars and their homes; and this\\nstate of things, which has made some of them brave and warlike, has made\\nnone poets or painters, historians or philosophers. There, poetry has not\\nwanted themes of great achievement and noble daring; but heroes have\\nwanted poets. Nor can we justly ascribe the difference to the enervating\\ninfluence of climate, for the temperature of the most southern parts of\\nAfrica differs little from that of Greece. And the tropical nations, too,\\nof your own continent, the Peruvians, were more improved than those who\\ninhabited the temperate regions. Besides, though the climate had instilled\\nsoftness and feebleness of character, it might also have permitted the\\ncultivation of the arts, as has been the case with us in Asia. On the\\nwhole, without our being able to pronounce with certainty on the subject,\\nit does seem probable that some organic difference exists in the various\\nraces of mankind, to which their diversities of moral and intellectual\\ncharacter may in part be referred.\"--By this time the Morea and the\\nGrecian Archipelago were directly under our telescope.\\n\\n\"Does not Greece,\" said I, \"furnish the clearest proof of the influence\\nof moral causes on the character of nations? Compare what that country\\nformerly was, with what it now is. Once superior to all the rest of the\\nhabitable globe, (of which it did not constitute the thousandth part,)\\nin letters, arts, and arms, and all that distinguishes men from brutes;\\nnot merely in their own estimation, (for all nations are disposed to rate\\nthemselves high enough,) but by the general consent of the rest of the\\nworld. Do not the most improved and civilized of modern states still take\\nthem as their instructors and guides in every species of literature--in\\nphilosophy, history, oratory, poetry, architecture, and sculpture? And\\nthose too, who have attained superiority over the world, in arms, yield\\na voluntary subjection to the Greeks in the arts. The cause of their\\nformer excellence and their present inferiority, is no doubt to be found\\nin their former freedom and their present slavery, and in the loss of\\nthat emulation which seems indispensable to natural greatness.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" replied he, \"I am very far from denying the influence of moral\\ncauses on national character. The history of every country affords\\nabundant evidence of it. I mean only to say, that though it does much,\\nit does not do every thing. It seems more reasonable to impute the changes\\nin national character to the mutable habits and institutions of man,\\nthan to nature, which is always the same. But if we look a little nearer,\\nwe may perhaps perceive, that amidst all those mutations in the character\\nof nations, there are still some features that are common to the same\\npeople at all times, and which it would therefore be reasonable to\\nimpute to the great unvarying laws of nature. Thus it requires no\\nextraordinary acuteness of observation, no strained hypothesis, to\\nperceive a close resemblance between the Germans or the Britons of\\nantiquity and their modern descendants, after the lapse of eighteen\\ncenturies, and an entire revolution in government, religion, language,\\nand laws. And travellers still perceive among the inhabitants of modern\\nGreece, deteriorated and debased as they are by political servitude,\\nmany of those qualities which distinguished their predecessors: the\\nsame natural acuteness--the same sensibility to pleasure--the same\\npliancy of mind and elasticity of body--the same aptitude for the arts\\nof imitation--and the same striking physiognomy. That bright, serene\\nsky--that happy combination of land and water, constituting the perfection\\nof the picturesque, and that balmy softness of its air, which have proved\\nthemselves so propitious to forms of beauty, agility, and strength, also\\noperate benignantly on the mind which animates them. Whilst the fruit\\nis still fair to the eye, it is not probable that it has permanently\\ndegenerated in fragrance or flavour. The great diversities of national\\ncharacter may, perhaps, be attributed principally to moral and accidental\\ncauses, but partly also to climate, and to original diversities in the\\ndifferent races of man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n_Continuation of the voyage--View of Europe; Atlantic Ocean; America--\\nSpeculations on the future destiny of the United States--Moral reflections\\n--Pacific Ocean--Hypothesis on the origin of the Moon._\\n\\n\\nBy this time the whole Mediterranean Sea, which, with the Arabian Gulf,\\nwas seen to separate Africa from Europe and Asia, was full in our view.\\nThe political divisions of these quarters of the world were, of course,\\nundistinguishable; and few of the natural were discernible by the naked\\neye. The Alps were marked by a white streak, though less bright than the\\nwater. By the aid of our glass, we could just discern the Danube, the\\nNile, and a river which empties itself into the Gulf of Guinea, and which\\nI took to be the Niger: but the other streams were not perceptible. The\\nmost conspicuous object of the solid part of the globe, was the Great\\nDesert before mentioned. The whole of Africa, indeed, was of a lighter hue\\nthan either Asia or Europe, owing, I presume, to its having a greater\\nproportion of sandy soil: and I could not avoid contrasting, in my mind,\\nthe colour of these continents, as they now appeared, with the complexions\\nof their respective inhabitants.\\n\\nI was struck too, with the vast disproportion which the extent of the\\nseveral countries of the earth bore to the part they had acted in history,\\nand the influence they had exerted on human affairs. The British islands\\nhad diminished to a speck, and France was little larger; yet, a few\\nyears ago it seemed, at least to us in the United States, as if there\\nwere no other nations on the earth. The Brahmin, who was well read in\\nEuropean history, on my making a remark on this subject, reminded me that\\nAthens and Sparta had once obtained almost equal celebrity, although\\nthey were so small as not now to be visible. As I slowly passed the\\ntelescope over the face of Europe, I pictured to myself the fat, plodding\\nHollander--the patient, contemplative German--the ingenious, sensual\\nItalian--the temperate Swiss--the haughty, superstitious Spaniard--the\\nsprightly, self-complacent Frenchman--the sullen and reflecting Englishman\\n--who monopolize nearly all the science and literature of the earth,\\nto which they bear so small a proportion. As the Atlantic fell under our\\nview, two faint circles on each side of the equator, were to be perceived\\nby the naked eye. They were less bright than the rest of the ocean. The\\nBrahmin suggested that they might be currents; which brought to my memory\\nDr. Franklin\\'s conjecture on the subject, now completely verified by this\\ncircular line of vapour, as it had been previously rendered probable by\\nthe floating substances, which had been occasionally picked up, at great\\ndistances from the places where they had been thrown into the ocean. The\\ncircle was whiter and more distinct, where the Gulf Stream runs parallel\\nto the American coast, and gradually grew fainter as it passed along the\\nBanks of Newfoundland, to the coast of Europe, where, taking a southerly\\ndirection, the line of the circle was barely discernible. A similar circle\\nof vapour, though less defined and complete, was perceived in the South\\nAtlantic Ocean.\\n\\nWhen the coast of my own beloved country first presented itself to my\\nview, I experienced the liveliest emotions; and I felt so anxious to see\\nmy children and friends, that I would gladly have given up all the\\npromised pleasures of our expedition. I even ventured to hint my feelings\\nto the Brahmin; but he, gently rebuking my impatience, said--\\n\\n\"If to return home had been your only object, and not to see what not one\\nof your nation or race has ever yet seen, you ought to have so informed\\nme, that we might have arranged matters accordingly. I do not wish you\\nto return to your country, until you will be enabled to make yourself\\nwelcome and useful there, by what you may see in the lunar world. Take\\ncourage, then, my friend; you have passed the worst; and, as the proverb\\nsays, do not, when you have swallowed the ox, now choke at the tail.\\nBesides, although we made all possible haste in descending, we should,\\nere we reached the surface, find ourselves to the west of your continent,\\nand be compelled then to choose between some part of Asia or the Pacific\\nOcean.\"\\n\\n\"Let us then proceed,\" said I, mortified at the imputation on my courage,\\nand influenced yet more, perhaps, by the last argument. The Brahmin then\\ntried to soothe my disappointment, by his remarks on my native land.\\n\\n\"I have a great curiosity,\" said he, \"to see a country where a man, by\\nhis labour, can earn as much in a month as will procure him bread, and\\nmeat too, for the whole year; in a week, as will pay his dues to the\\ngovernment; and in one or two days, as will buy him an acre of good land:\\nwhere every man preaches whatever religion he pleases; where the priests\\nof the different sects never fight, and seldom quarrel; and, stranger\\nthan all, where the authority of government derives no aid from an army,\\nand that of the priests no support from the law.\"\\n\\nI told him, when he should see these things in operation with his\\nown eyes, as I trusted he would, if it pleased heaven to favour our\\nundertakings, they would appear less strange. I reminded him of the\\npeculiar circumstances under which our countrymen had commenced their\\ncareer.\\n\\n\"In all other countries,\" said I, \"civilization and population have\\ngone hand in hand; and the necessity of an increasing subsistence\\nfor increasing numbers, has been the parent of useful arts and of\\nsocial improvement. In every successive stage of their advancement,\\nsuch countries have equally felt the evils occasioned by a scanty and\\nprecarious subsistence. In America, however, the people are in the full\\nenjoyment of all the arts of civilization, while they are unrestricted\\nin their means of subsistence, and consequently in their power of\\nmultiplication. From this singular state of things, two consequences\\nresult. One is, that the progress of the nation in wealth, power, and\\ngreatness, is more rapid than the world has ever before witnessed.\\nAnother is, that our people, being less cramped and fettered by their\\nnecessities, and feeling, of course, less of those moral evils which\\npoverty and discomfort engender, their character, moral and intellectual,\\nwill be developed and matured with greater celerity, and, I incline\\nto think, carried to a higher point of excellence than has ever yet\\nbeen attained. I anticipate for them the eloquence and art of Athens--the\\ncourage and love of country of Sparta--the constancy and military prowess\\nof the Romans--the science and literature of England and France--the\\nindustry of the Dutch--the temperance and obedience to the laws of the\\nSwiss. In fifty years, their numbers will amount to forty millions; in\\na century, to one hundred and sixty millions; in two centuries, (allowing\\nfor a decreasing rate of multiplication,) to three or four hundred\\nmillions. Nor does it seem impossible that, from the structure of their\\ngovernment, they may continue united for a few great national purposes,\\nwhile each State may make the laws that are suited to its peculiar habits,\\ncharacter, and circumstances. In another half century, they will extend\\nthe Christian religion and the English language to the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n\"To the south of them, on the same continent, other great nations will\\narise, who, if they were to be equally united, might contend in terrible\\nconflicts for the mastery of this great continent, and even of the world.\\nBut when they shall be completely liberated from the yoke of Spanish\\ndominion, and have for some time enjoyed that full possession of their\\nfaculties and energies which liberty only can give, they will probably\\nsplit into distinct States. United, at first, by the sympathy of men\\nstruggling in the same cause, and by similarity of manners and religion,\\nthey will, after a while, do as men always have done, quarrel and fight;\\nand these wars will check their social improvement, and mar their\\npolitical hopes. Whether they will successively fall under the dominion\\nof one able and fortunate leader, or, like the motley sovereignties of\\nEurope, preserve their integrity by their mutual jealousy, time only can\\nshow.\"\\n\\n\"Your reasoning about the natives of Spanish America appears very\\nprobable,\" said the Brahmin; \"but is it not equally applicable to your\\nown country ?\"\\n\\nI reminded him of the peculiar advantages of our government. He shook\\nhis head.\\n\\n\"No, Atterley,\" said he, \"do not deceive yourself. The duration of every\\nspecies of polity is uncertain; the works of nature alone are permanent.\\nThe motions of the heavenly bodies are the same as they were thousands\\nof years ago. But not so with the works of man. He is the identical animal\\nthat he ever was. His political institutions, however cunningly devised,\\nhave always been yet more perishable than his structures of stone and\\nmarble. This is according to all past history: and do not, therefore,\\ncount upon an exception in your favour, that would be little short of\\nthe miraculous. But,\" he good-naturedly added, \"such a miracle may take\\nplace in your system; and, although I do not expect it, I sincerely\\nwish it.\"\\n\\nWe were now able to see one half of the broad expanse of the Pacific,\\nwhich glistened with the brightness of quicksilver or polished steel.\\n\\n\"Cast your eyes to the north,\" said he, \"and see where your continent\\nand mine approach so near as almost to touch. Both these coasts are\\nat this time thinly inhabited by a rude and miserable people, whose\\nwhole time is spent in struggling against the rigours of their dreary\\nclimate, and the scantiness of its productions. Yet, perhaps the Indians\\nand the Kamtschadales will be gradually moulded into a hardy, civilized\\npeople: and here may be the scene of many a fierce conflict between your\\npeople and the Russians, whose numbers, now four times as great as yours,\\nincrease almost as rapidly.\"\\n\\nHe then amused me with accounts of the manners and mode of life of the\\nHyperborean race, with whom he had once passed a summer. Glancing my eye\\nthen to the south,--\"See,\" said I, \"while the Kamtschadale is providing\\nhis supply of furs and of fish, for the long winter which is already\\nknocking at the door of his hut, the gay and voluptuous native of the\\nSandwich and other islands between the tropics. How striking the contrast!\\nThe one passes his life in ease, abundance, and enjoyment; the other in\\ntoil, privation, and care. No inclemency of the seasons inflicts present\\nsuffering on these happy islanders, or brings apprehensions for the\\nfuture. Nature presents them with her most delicious fruits spontaneously\\nand abundantly; and she has implanted in their breast a lively relish for\\nthe favours she so lavishly bestows upon them.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin, after musing a while, replied: \"The difference is far less\\nthan you imagine. Perhaps, on balancing their respective pleasures and\\npains, the superior gain of the islander will be reduced to nothing: for,\\nas to the simplest source of gratification, that of palatable food, if\\nnature produces it more liberally in the islands, she also produces there\\nmore mouths to consume it. The richest Kamtschadale may, indeed, oftener\\ngo without a dinner than the richest Otaheitan; but it may be quite the\\nreverse with the poorest. Then, as to quality of the food: if nature\\nhas provided more delicious fruits for the natives of tropical climates,\\nshe has given a sharper appetite and stronger digestion to the Hyperborean,\\nwhich equalizes the sum of their enjoyments. A dry crust is relished, when\\nan individual is hungry, more than the most savoury and delicate dainties\\nwhen he is in a fever; and water to one man, is a more delicious beverage\\nthan the juice of the grape or of the palm to another. As to the necessity\\nfor labour, which is ever pressing on the inhabitants of cold countries,\\nit is this consequent and incessant activity which gives health to their\\nbodies, and cheerful vigour to their minds; since, without such exercise,\\nman would have been ever a prey to disease and discontent. And, if no\\nother occupation be provided for the mind of man, it carves out employment\\nfor itself in vain regrets and gloomy forebodings--in jealousy, envy, and\\nthe indulgence of every hateful and tormenting passion: hence the\\nproverb,--\\'If you want corn, cultivate your soil; if you want weeds, let\\nit alone.\\'\\n\\n\"But again: the native of those sunny isles is never sensible of the\\nbounty of Providence, till he is deprived of it. Here, as well as every\\nwhere else, desire outgoes gratification. Man sees or fancies much that\\nhe cannot obtain; and in his regret for what he wants, forgets what he\\nalready possesses. What is it to one with a tooth-ache, that a savoury\\ndish is placed before him? It is the same with the mind as the body: when\\npain engrosses it in one way, it cannot relish pleasure in another. Every\\nclimate and country too, have their own evils and inconveniences.\"\\n\\n\"You think, then,\" said I, \"that the native of Kamtschatka has the\\nadvantage?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he rejoined, \"I do not mean to say that, for the evils of his\\nsituation are likewise very great; but they are more manifest, and\\ntherefore less necessary to be brought to your notice.\"\\n\\nIt was now, by our time-pieces, about two o\\'clock in the afternoon--that\\nis, two hours had elapsed since we left terra firma; and, saving a few\\nbiscuits and a glass of cordial a-piece, we had not taken any sort of\\nrefreshment. The Brahmin proposed that we now should dine; and, opening\\na small case, and drawing forth a cold fowl, a piece of dried goat\\'s\\nflesh, a small pot of ghee, some biscuits, and a bottle of arrack\\nflavoured with ginger and spices, with a larger one of water, we ate as\\nheartily as we had ever done at the hermitage; the slight motion of our\\nmachine to one side or the other, whenever we moved, giving us nearly\\nas much exercise as a vessel in a smooth sea. The animal food had been\\nprovided for me, for the Brahmin satisfied his hunger with the ghee,\\nsweetmeats, and biscuit, and ate sparingly even of them. We each took\\ntwo glasses of the cordial diluted with water, and carefully putting\\nback the fragments, again turned our thoughts to the planet we had left.\\n\\nThe middle of the Pacific now lay immediately beneath us. I had never\\nbefore been struck with the irregular distribution of land and water on\\nour globe, the expanse of ocean here being twice as large as in any\\nother part; and, on remarking this striking difference to the Brahmin,\\nhe replied:\\n\\n\"It is the opinion of some philosophers in the moon, that their globe\\nis a fragment of ours; and, as they can see every part of the earth\\'s\\nsurface, they believe the Pacific was the place from which the moon was\\nejected. They pretend that a short, but consistent tradition of the\\ndisruption, has regularly been transmitted from remote antiquity; and\\nthey draw confirmation of their hypothesis from many words of the Chinese,\\nand other Orientals, with whom they claim affinity.\"\\n\\n\"Ridiculous!\" said I; \"the moon is one-fourth the diameter of the earth;\\nand if the two were united in one sphere, the highest mountains must\\nhave been submerged, and of course there would have been no human\\ninhabitants; or, if any part of the land was then bare, on the waters\\nretiring to fill up the chasm made by the separation of so large a body\\nas the moon, the parts before habitable would be, instead of two, three,\\nor at most four miles, as your Himalah mountains are said to be, some\\ntwenty or thirty miles above the level of the ocean.\"\\n\\n\"That is not quite so certain,\" said he: \"we know not of what the interior\\nof the earth is composed, any more than we could distinguish the contents\\nof an egg, by penetrating one hundredth part of its shell. But we see,\\nthat if one drop of water be united with another, they form one large\\ndrop, as spherical as either of the two which composed it: and on the\\nseparation of the moon from the earth, if they were composed of mingled\\nsolids and fluids, or if the solid parts rested on fluid, both the\\nfragment and the remaining earth would assume the same globular appearance\\nthey now present.\\n\\n\"On this subject, however, I give no opinion. I only say, that it is not\\ncontradicted by the facts you have mentioned. The fluid and the solid\\nparts settling down into a new sphere, might still retain nearly their\\nformer proportion: or, if the fragment took away a greater proportion\\nof solid than of fluid, then the waters retiring to fill up the cavity,\\nwould leave parts bare which they had formerly covered. There are some\\nfacts which give a colour to this supposition; for most of the high\\nmountains of the earth afford evidence of former submersion; and those\\nwhich are the highest, the Himalah, are situated in the country to which\\nthe origin of civilization, and even the human species itself, may be\\ntraced. The moon too, we know, has much less water than the earth: and\\nall those appearances of violence, which have so puzzled cosmogonists,\\nthe topsy-turvy position in which vegetable substances are occasionally\\nfound beneath the soil on which they grew, and the clear manifestations\\nof the action of water, in the formation of strata, in the undulating\\nforms it has left, and in the correspondent salient and retiring angles\\nof mountains and opposite coasts, were all caused by the disruption;\\nand as the moon has a smaller proportion of water than the earth, she\\nhas also the highest mountains.\"\\n\\n\"But, father,\" said I, \"the diameter of the earth being but four times\\nas large as that of the moon, how can the violent separation of so large\\na portion of our planet be accounted for? Where is the mighty agent to\\nrend off such a mass, and throw it to thirty times the earth\\'s diameter?\"\\n\\n\"Upon that subject,\" said he, \"the Lunarian sages are much divided.\\nMany hypotheses have been suggested on the subject, some of which are\\nvery ingenious, and all very fanciful: but the two most celebrated, and\\ninto which all the others are now merged, are those of Neerlego and\\nDarcandarca; the former of whom, in a treatise extending to nine quarto\\nvolumes, has maintained that the disruption was caused by a comet; and\\nthe latter, in a work yet more voluminous, has endeavoured to prove, that\\nwhen the materials of the moon composed a part of the earth, this planet\\ncontained large masses of water, which, though the particles cohered with\\neach other, were disposed to fly off from the earth; and that, by an\\naccumulation of the electric fluid, according to laws which he has\\nattempted to explain, the force was at length sufficient to heave the\\nrocks which encompassed these masses, from their beds, and to project\\nthem from the earth, when, partaking of the earth\\'s diurnal motion, they\\nassumed a spherical form, and revolved around it. And further, that\\nbecause the moon is composed of two sorts of matter, that are differently\\naffected towards the earth in its revolution round that planet, the same\\nparts of its surface always maintain some relative position to us, which\\nthus necessarily causes the singularity of her turning on her axis\\nprecisely in the time in which she revolves round the earth.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said I, \"that doctors differ and dispute about their own fancies\\nevery where.\"\\n\\n\"That is,\" said he, \"because they contend as vehemently for what they\\nimagine as for what they see; and perhaps more so, as their _perceptions_\\nare like those of other men, while their _reveries_ are more exclusively\\ntheir own. Thus, in the present instance, the controversy turns upon the\\nmode in which the separation was effected, which affords the widest field\\nfor conjecture, while they both agree that such separation has taken\\nplace. As to this fact I have not yet made up my mind, though it must\\nbe confessed that there is much to give plausibility to their opinion.\\nI recognise, for instance, a striking resemblance between the animal\\nand vegetable productions of Asia and those of the moon.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think, father,\" said I, \"that animal, or even vegetable life,\\ncould possibly exist in such a disruption as is supposed?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said he: \"you are not to imagine that the shock would be felt\\nin proportion to the mass that was moved. On the contrary, while it would\\noccasion, in some parts, a great destruction of life, it would, in others,\\nnot be felt more than an earthquake, or rather, than a succession of\\nearthquakes, during the time that the different parts of the mass were\\nadjusting themselves to a spherical form; whilst a few pairs, or even a\\nsingle pair of animals, saved in some cavity of a mountain, would be\\nsufficient, in a few centuries, to stock the whole surface of the earth\\nwith as many individuals as are now to be found on it.\\n\\n\"After all,\" he added, \"it is often difficult in science to distinguish\\nTruth from the plausibility which personates her. But let us not, however,\\nbe precipitate; let us but hear both sides. In the east we have a saying,\\nthat \\'he who hears with but one ear, never hears well.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n_The voyage continued--Second view of Asia--The Brahmin\\'s speculations\\nconcerning India--Increase of the Moon\\'s attraction--Appearance of the\\nMoon--They land on the Moon._\\n\\n\\nThe dryness of the preceding discussion, which lay out of the course of\\nmy studies, together with the effect of my dinner, began to make me a\\nlittle drowsy; whereupon the Brahmin urged me to take the repose which\\nit was clear I needed; remarking, that when I awoke, he would follow\\nmy example. Reclining my head, then, on my cloak, in a few minutes my\\nsenses were steeped in forgetfulness.\\n\\nI slept about six hours most profoundly; and on waking, found the good\\nBrahmin busy with his calculations of our progress. I insisted on his\\nnow taking some rest. After requesting me to wake him at the end of three\\nhours, (or sooner, if any thing of moment should occur,) and putting up\\na short prayer, which was manifested by his looks, rather than by his\\nwords, he laid himself down, and soon fell into a quiet sleep.\\n\\nLeft now to my own meditations, and unsupported by the example and\\nconversation of my friend, I felt my first apprehensions return, and\\nbegan seriously to regret my rashness in thus venturing on so bold an\\nexperiment, which, however often repeated with success, must ever be\\nhazardous, and which could plead little more in its favour than a vain\\nand childish curiosity. I took up a book, but whilst my eye ran over the\\npage, I understood but little what I read, and could not relish even that.\\nI now looked down through the telescope, and found the earth surprisingly\\ndiminished in her apparent dimensions, from the increased rapidity of our\\nascent. The eastern coasts of Asia were still fully in view, as well as\\nthe entire figure of that vast continent--of New Holland--of Ceylon, and\\nof Borneo; but the smaller islands were invisible. I strained my eye to\\nno purpose, to follow the indentations of the coast, according to the map\\nbefore me; the great bays and promontories could alone be perceived. The\\nBurman Empire, in one of the insignificant villages of which I had been\\nconfined for a few years, was now reduced to a speck. The agreeable\\nhours I had passed with the Brahmin, with the little daughter of Sing Fou,\\nand my rambling over the neighbouring heights, all recurred to my mind,\\nand I almost regretted the pleasures I had relinquished. I tried, with\\nmore success, to beguile the time by making notes in my journal; and after\\nhaving devoted about an hour to this object, I returned to the telescope,\\nand now took occasion to examine the figure of the earth near the Poles,\\nwith a view of discovering whether its form favoured Captain Symmes\\'s\\ntheory of an aperture existing there; and I am convinced that that\\ningenious gentleman is mistaken. Time passed so heavily during these\\nsolitary occupations, that I looked at my watch every five minutes, and\\ncould scarcely be persuaded it was not out of order. I then took up my\\nlittle Bible, (which had always been my travelling companion,) read a\\nfew chapters in St. Matthew, and found my feelings tranquillized, and\\nmy courage increased. The desired hour at length arrived; when, on waking\\nthe old man, he alertly raised himself up, and at the first view of the\\ndiminished appearance of the earth, observed that our journey was a third\\nover, as to time, but not as to distance. After a few moments, the Brahmin\\nagain cast his eye towards his own natal soil; on beholding which, he\\nfetched a deep sigh, and, if I was not mistaken, I saw a rising tear.\\n\\n\"Alas!\" said he, \"my country and my countrymen, how different you are in\\nmany respects from what I should wish you to be! And yet I do not love\\nyou the less. Perhaps I love you the more for your faults, as well as\\nfor your misfortunes.\\n\\n\"Our lot,\" continued he, \"is a hard one. That quarter of the world has\\nsent letters, and arts, and religion abroad to adorn and benefit the\\nother four; and these, the chief of human blessings and glories, have\\ndeserted us!\"\\n\\nI told him that I had heard the honours, which he claimed for India,\\nattributed to Egypt. He contended, with true love of country, great\\nplausibility, and an intimate knowledge of Oriental history, that letters\\nand the arts had been first transplanted from Asia into Egypt.\\n\\n\"No other part of Africa,\" said he, \"saving Egypt, can boast of any\\nancient monuments of the arts or of civilization. Even the pyramids,\\nthe great boast of Egypt, are proofs of nothing more than ordinary patient\\nlabour, directed by despotic power. Besides, look at that vast region,\\nextending five thousand miles from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good\\nHope, and four thousand from the Red Sea to the Atlantic. Its immense\\nsurface contains only ignorant barbarians, who are as uncivilized now as\\nthey were three thousand years ago. Is it likely that if civilization and\\nletters originated in Egypt, as is sometimes pretended, it would have\\nspread so extensively in one direction, and not at all in another?\\nI make no exception in favour of the Carthagenians, whose origin was\\ncomparatively recent, and who, we know, were a colony from Asia.\"\\n\\nI was obliged to admit the force of this reasoning; and, when he proceeded\\nto descant on the former glories and achievements of Asiatic nations,\\nand their sad reverses of fortune--while he freely spoke of the present\\ndegradation and imbecility of his countrymen, he promptly resisted every\\ncensure of mine. It was easy, indeed, to see that he secretly cherished\\na hope that the day would come, when the whole of Hindostan would be\\nemancipated from its European masters, and assume that rank among nations\\nto which the genius of its inhabitants entitled it. He admitted that the\\ndominion of the English was less oppressive than that of their native\\nprinces; but said, that there was this great difference between foreign\\nand domestic despotism,--that the former completely extinguished all\\nnational pride, which is as much the cause as the effect of national\\ngreatness.\\n\\nI asked him whether he thought if his countrymen were to shake off the\\nyoke of the English, they could maintain their independence?\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said he. \"Who would be able to conquer us?\"\\n\\nI suggested to him that they might tempt the ambition of Russia; and\\ncautiously inquired, whether the abstinence from animal food might not\\nrender his country much less capable of resistance; and whether it might\\nnot serve to explain why India had so often been the prey of foreign\\nconquest? Of this, however, he would hear nothing; but replied, with\\nmore impatience than was usual with him--\\n\\n\"It is true, Hindostan was invaded by Alexander--but not conquered; and\\nthat it has since submitted, in succession, to the Arabians, to the\\nTartars, under Genghis Khan, and under Tamerlane; to the Persians, under\\nNadir Shah, and, finally, to the British. But there are few countries\\nof Europe which have not been conquered as often. That nation from which\\nyou are descended, and to which mine is now subject, furnishes no\\nexception, as it has been subjugated, in succession, by the Romans, the\\nDanes, the Saxons, the Normans. And, as to courage, we see no difference\\nbetween those Asiatics who eat animal food as you do, and those who\\nabstain from it as I do. I am told that the Scotch peasantry eat much\\nless animal food than the English, and the Irish far less than they; and\\nyet, that these rank among the best troops of the British. But surely a\\nnation ought not to be suspected of fearing death, whose very women show\\na contempt of life which no other people have exhibited.\"\\n\\nThis led us to talk of that strange custom of his country, which impels\\nthe widow to throw herself on the funeral pile of her husband, and to be\\nconsumed with him. I told him that it had often been represented as\\ncompulsory--or, in other words, that it was said that every art and means\\nwere resorted to, for the purpose of working on the mind of the woman, by\\nher relatives, aided by the priests, who would be naturally gratified by\\nsuch signal triumphs of religion over the strongest feelings of nature. He\\nadmitted that these engines were sometimes put in operation, and that\\nthey impelled to the sacrifice, some who were wavering; but insisted, that\\nin a majority of instances the _Suttee_ was voluntary.\\n\\n\"Women,\" said he, \"are brought up from their infancy, to regard our sex\\nas their superiors, and to believe that their greatest merit consists in\\nentire devotion to their husbands. Under this feeling, and having, at\\nthe same time, their attention frequently turned to the chance of such a\\ncalamity, they are better prepared to meet it when it occurs. How few of\\nthe officers in your western armies, ever hesitate to march, at the head\\nof their men, on a forlorn hope? and how many even court the danger for\\nthe sake of the glory? Nay, you tell me that, according to your code of\\nhonour, if one man insults another, he who gives the provocation, and he\\nwho receives it, rather than be disgraced in the eyes of their countrymen,\\nwill go out, and quietly shoot at each other with firearms, till one of\\nthem is killed or wounded; and this too, in many cases, when the injury\\nhas been merely nominal. If you show such a contempt of death, in\\ndeference to a custom founded in mere caprice, can it be wondered that\\na woman should show it, in the first paroxysms of her grief for the\\nloss of him to whom was devoted every thought, word, and action of her\\nlife, and who, next to her God, was the object of her idolatry? My dear\\nAtterley,\" he continued, with emotion, \"you little know the strength of\\nwoman\\'s love!\"\\n\\nHere he abruptly broke off the conversation; and, after continuing\\nthoughtful and silent for some time, he remarked:\\n\\n\"But do not forget where we are. Nature demands her accustomed rest, and\\nlet us prepare to indulge her. I feel little inclined to sleep at\\npresent; yet, by the time you have taken some hours\\' repose, I shall\\nprobably require the same refreshment.\"\\n\\nI would willingly have listened longer; but, yielding to his prudent\\nsuggestion, again composed myself to rest, and left my good monitor to\\nhis melancholy meditations. When I had slept about four hours, I was\\nawakened by the Brahmin, in whose arms I found myself, and who, feeble\\nas he was, handled me with the ease that a nurse does a child, or rather,\\nas a child does her doll. On looking around, I found myself lying on what\\nhad been the ceiling of our chamber, which still, however, felt like the\\nbottom. My eyes and my feelings were thus in collision, and I could only\\naccount for what I saw, by supposing that the machine had been turned\\nupside down. I was bewildered and alarmed.\\n\\nAfter enjoying my surprise for a moment, the Brahmin observed: \"We have,\\nwhile you were asleep, passed the middle point between the earth\\'s and the\\nmoon\\'s attraction, and we now gravitate less towards our own planet than\\nher satellite. I took the precaution to move you, before you fell by your\\nown gravity, from what was lately the bottom, to that which is now so,\\nand to keep you in this place until you were retained in it by the moon\\'s\\nattraction; for, though your fall would have been, at this point, like\\nthat of a feather, yet it would have given you some shock and alarm. The\\nmachine, therefore, has undergone no change in its position or course;\\nthe change is altogether in our feelings.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin then, after having looked through either telescope, but for\\na longer time through the one at the bottom, and having performed his\\ncustomary devotions, soon fell into a slumber, but not into the same\\nquiet sleep as before, for he was often interrupted by sudden starts,\\nof so distressing a character, that I was almost tempted to wake him.\\nAfter a while, however, he seemed more composed, when I betook myself\\nto the telescope turned towards the earth.\\n\\nThe earth\\'s appearance I found so diminished as not to exceed four times\\nthe diameter of the moon, as seen from the earth, and its whole face was\\nentirely changed. After the first surprise, I recollected it was the\\nmoon I was then regarding, and my curiosity was greatly awakened. On\\nraising myself up, and looking through the upper telescope, the earth\\npresented an appearance not very dissimilar; but the outline of her\\ncontinents and oceans were still perceptible, in different shades, and\\ncapable of being easily recognised; but the bright glare of the sun made\\nthe surfaces of both bodies rather dim and pale.\\n\\nAfter a short interval, I again looked at the moon, and found not only\\nits magnitude very greatly increased, but that it was beginning to\\npresent a more beautiful spectacle. The sun\\'s rays fell obliquely on\\nher disc, so that by a large part of its surface not reflecting the light,\\nI saw every object on it, so far as I was enabled by the power of my\\ntelescope. Its mountains, lakes, seas, continents, and islands, were\\nfaintly, though not indistinctly, traced; and every moment brought\\nforth something new to catch my eye, and awaken my curiosity. The\\nwhole face of the moon was of a silvery hue, relieved and varied by the\\nsoftest and most delicate shades. No cloud nor speck of vapour intercepted\\nmy view. One of my exclamations of delight awakened the Brahmin, who\\nquickly arose, and looking down on the resplendent orb below us, observed\\nthat we must soon begin to slacken the rapidity of our course, by\\nthrowing out ballast. The moon\\'s dimensions now rapidly increased; the\\nseparate mountains, which formed the ridges and chains on her surface,\\nbegan to be plainly visible through the telescope; whilst, on the shaded\\nside, several volcanoes appeared upon her disc, like the flashes of\\nour fire-fly, or rather like the twinkling of stars in a frosty night.\\nHe remarked, that the extraordinary clearness and brightness of the\\nobjects on the moon\\'s surface, was owing to her having a less extensive\\nand more transparent atmosphere than the earth: adding--\"The difference\\nis so great, that some of our astronomical observers have been induced\\nto think she has none. If that, however, had been the case, our voyage\\nwould have been impracticable.\"\\n\\nAfter gazing at the magnificent spectacle, with admiration and delight,\\nfor half an hour, the Brahmin loosed one of the balls of the lunar metal,\\nfor the purpose of checking our velocity. At this time he supposed we\\nwere not more than four thousand miles, or about twice the moon\\'s\\ndiameter, from the nearest point of her surface. In about four hours\\nmore, her apparent magnitude was so great, that we could see her by\\nlooking out of either of the dark side-windows. Her disc had now lost\\nits former silvery appearance, and began to look more like that of the\\nearth, when seen at the same distance. It was a most gratifying spectacle\\nto behold the objects successively rising to our view, and steadily\\nenlarging in their dimensions. The rapidity with which we approached the\\nmoon, impressed me, in spite of myself, with the alarming sensation of\\nfalling; and I found myself alternately agitated with a sense of this\\ndanger, and with impatience to take a nearer view of the new objects that\\ngreeted my eyes. The Brahmin was wholly absorbed in calculations for the\\npurpose of adjusting our velocity to the distance we had to go, his\\nestimates of which, however, were in a great measure conjectural; and\\never and anon he would let off a ball of the lunar metal.\\n\\nAfter a few hours, we were so near the moon that every object was seen in\\nour glass, as distinctly as the shells or marine plants through a piece\\nof shallow sea-water, though the eye could take in but a small part of\\nher surface, and the horizon, which bounded our view, was rapidly\\ncontracting. On letting the air escape from our machine, it did not now\\nrush out with the same violence as before, which showed that we were\\nwithin the moon\\'s atmosphere. This, as well as ridding ourselves of the\\nmetal balls, aided in checking our progress. By and bye we were within a\\nfew miles of the highest mountains, when we threw down so much of our\\nballast, that we soon appeared almost stationary. The Brahmin remarked,\\nthat he should avail himself of the currents of air we might meet with,\\nto select a favourable place for landing, though we were necessarily\\nattracted towards the same region, in consequence of the same half of\\nthe moon\\'s surface being always turned towards the earth.\\n\\n\"In our second voyage,\" said he, \"we were glad to get foothold any where;\\nfor, not having lightened our machine sufficiently, we came down, with a\\nconsiderable concussion, on a barren field, remote from any human\\nhabitation, and suffered more from hunger and cold, for nearly three days,\\nthan we had done from the perils and privations of the voyage. The next\\ntime we aimed at landing near the town of Alamatua, which stands, as you\\nmay see, a little to the right of us, upon an island in a lake, and looks\\nlike an emerald set in silver. We came down very gently, it is true, but\\nwe struck one of the numerous boats which ply around the island, and had\\nnearly occasioned the loss of our lives, as well as of theirs. In our\\nlast voyage we were every way fortunate. The first part of the moon we\\napproached, was a level plain, of great extent, divided into corn-fields,\\non which, having lowered our grapnel, we drew ourselves down without\\ndifficulty.\\n\\n\"We must now,\" continued he, \"look out for some cultivated field, in one\\nof the valleys we are approaching, where we may rely on being not far\\nfrom some human abode, and on escaping the perils of rocks, trees, and\\nbuildings.\"\\n\\nWhile the Brahmin was speaking, a gentle breeze arose, as appeared by our\\nhorizontal motion, which wafted us at the rate of about ten miles an hour,\\nin succession, over a ridge of mountains, a lake, a thick wood, and a\\nsecond lake, until at length we reached a cultivated region, recognised\\nby the Brahmin as the country of the Morosofs, the place we were most\\nanxious to reach.\\n\\n\"Let off two of the balls of lead to the earth,\" said he. I did so, and\\nwe descended rapidly. When we were sufficiently near the ground to see\\nthat it was a fit place for landing, we opened the door, and found the\\nair of the moon inconceivably sweet and refreshing. We now loosed one of\\nthe lower balls, and somewhat checked our descent. In a few minutes more,\\nhowever, we were within twenty yards of the ground, when we let go the\\nlargest ball of lunarium, which, having a cord attached to it, served us\\nin lieu of a grapnel. It descended with great force to the ground, while\\nthe machine, thus lightened, was disposed to mount again. We, however,\\ndrew ourselves down; and as soon as the machine touched the ground,\\nwe let off some of our leaden balls to keep it there. We released\\nourselves from the machine in a twinkling; and our first impulse was\\nto fall on our knees, and return thanks for our safe deliverance from\\nthe many perils of the voyage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n_Some account of Morosofia, and its chief city Alamatua--Singular\\ndresses of the Lunar ladies--Religious self denial--Glouglim miser and\\nspendthrift._\\n\\n\\nMy feelings, at the moment I touched the ground, repayed me for all I\\nhad endured. I looked around with the most intense curiosity; but nothing\\nthat I saw, surprised me so much as to find so little that was surprising.\\nThe vegetation, insects and other animals, were all pretty much of the\\nsame character as those I had seen before; but after I became better\\nacquainted with them, I found the difference to be much greater than I at\\nfirst supposed. Having refreshed ourselves with the remains of our stores,\\nand secured the door of our machine, we bent our course, by a plain road,\\ntowards the town we saw on the side of a mountain, about three miles\\ndistant, and entered it a little before the sun had descended behind the\\nadjacent mountain.\\n\\nThe town of Alamatua seemed to contain about two thousand houses, and to\\nbe not quite as large as Albany. The houses were built of a soft shining\\nstone, and they all had porticoes, piazzas, and verandas, suited to the\\ntropical climate of Morosofia. The people were tall and thin, of a pale\\nyellowish complexion; and their garments light, loose, and flowing, and\\nnot very different from those of the Turks. The lower order of people\\ncommonly wore but a single garment, which passed round the waist. One\\nhalf the houses were under ground, partly to screen them from the continued\\naction of the sun\\'s rays, and partly on account of the earthquakes caused\\nby volcanoes. The windows of their houses were different from any I had\\never seen before. They consisted of openings in the wall, sloping so\\nmuch upwards, that while they freely admitted the light and air, the sun\\nwas completely excluded: and although those who were within could readily\\nsee what was passing in the streets, they were concealed from the gaze of\\nthe curious. In their hot-houses, it was common to have mirrors in the\\nceilings, which at once reflected the street passengers to those who were\\non the floor, and enabled the ostentatious to display to the public eye\\nthe decorations of their tables, whenever they gave a sumptuous feast.\\n\\nThe inhabitants subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet; live about as long\\nas they do on the earth, notwithstanding the great difference of climate,\\nand other circumstances; and, in short, do not, in their manners, habits,\\nor character, differ more from the inhabitants of our planet, than some of\\nthese differ from one another. Their government was anciently monarchical,\\nbut is now popular. Their code of laws is said to be very intricate. Their\\nlanguage, naturally soft and musical, has been yet further refined by the\\ncultivation of letters. They have a variety of sects in religion,\\npolitics, and philosophy. The territory of Morosofia is about 150 miles\\nsquare. This brief sketch must content the reader for the present. I refer\\nthose who are desirous of being more particularly informed, to the work\\nwhich I propose to publish on lunar geography; and, in the mean time,\\nsome of the most striking peculiarities of this people, in opinions,\\nmanners, and customs, will be developed in this, which must be considered\\nas my _personal narrative_.\\n\\nAs soon as we were espied by the inhabitants, we were surrounded by a\\ntroop of little boys, as well as all the idle and inquisitive near us.\\nThe Brahmin had not gone far, before he was met by some persons of his\\nacquaintance, who immediately recognised him, and seemed very much pleased\\nto see him again in the moon. They politely conducted us to the house of\\nthe governor, who received us very graciously. He appeared to be about\\nforty-five years of age, was dressed in a pearl-coloured suit, and had a\\nmild, amiable deportment. He began a course of interesting inquiry about\\nthe affairs of the earth; but a gentleman, whom we afterwards understood\\nwas one of the leaders of the popular party, coming in, he soon despatched\\nus; having, however, first directed an officer to furnish us with all\\nthat was necessary for our accommodation, at the public expense--which\\nact of hospitality, we have reason to fear, occasioned him some trouble\\nand perplexity at the succeeding election. We very gladly withdrew, as\\nboth by reason of our long walk, and the excitement produced by so many\\nnew objects, we were greatly fatigued. The officer conducted us to\\nrespectable private lodgings, in a lightsome situation, which overlooked\\nthe chief part of the city.\\n\\nAfter a frugal, but not unpalatable repast, and a few hours\\' sleep,\\nthe Brahmin took me round the city and a part of its environs, to make me\\nacquainted with the public buildings, streets, shops, and the appearance\\nof the inhabitants. I soon found that our arrival was generally known\\nand that we excited quite as much curiosity as we felt, though many of\\nthe persons we met had seen the Brahmin before. I was surprised that we\\nsaw none of their women; but the Brahmin told me that they were every\\nwhere gazing through their windows; and, on looking up, through these\\nslanting apertures I could often see their eyes peeping over the upper\\nedge of the window-sill.\\n\\nI shall now proceed to record faithfully what I deem most memorable; not\\nas many travellers have done, from their recollection, after their return\\nhome, but from notes, which I regularly made, either at the moment of\\nobservation, or very shortly afterwards. When we first visited the shops,\\nI was equally gratified and surprised with what was familiar and what was\\nnew; but I was particularly amused with those of the tailors and milliners.\\nIn the lower part of their dress, the Lunarians chiefly resemble the\\nEuropeans; but in the upper part, the Asiatics--for they shave the head,\\nand wear turbans; from which fact the Brahmin drew another argument in\\nfavour of the hypothesis, that the moon was originally a part of the\\nearth. Some of the female fashions were so extremely singular and\\nfanciful, as to deserve particular mention.\\n\\nOne piece of their attire was formed of a long piece of light stiff\\nwood, covered with silk, and decorated with showy ornaments. It was\\nworn across the shoulders, beyond each of which it jutted out about half\\na yard; and from either end a cord led to a ring running round the upper\\npart of the head, bearing no small resemblance to the yard of a ship\\'s\\nmast, and the ropes used for steering it. Several other dresses I\\nsaw, which I am satisfied would be highly disapproved by my modest\\ncountrywomen. Thus, in some were inserted glasses like watch crystals,\\nadapted to the form and size of the female bosom. But, to do the Lunar\\nladies justice, I understood that these dresses were condemned by the\\nsedate part of the sex, and were worn only by the young and thoughtless,\\nwho were vain of their forms. I observed too, that instead of decorating\\ntheir heads with flowers, like the ladies of our earth, they taxed the\\nanimal world for a correspondent ornament. Many of the head-dresses were\\nmade of a stiff open gauze, occasionally stuck over with insects of the\\nbutterfly and _coccinella_ species, and others of the gayest hues. At\\nother times these insects were alive; when their perpetual buzzing and\\nfluttering in their transparent cages, had a very animating effect. One\\ndecoration for the head in particular struck my fancy: it was formed of a\\nsilver tissue, containing fireflies, and intended to be worn in the night.\\n\\nBut the most remarkable thing of all, was the whim of the ladies in\\nthe upper classes, of making themselves as much like birds as possible;\\nin which art, it must be confessed, they were wonderfully successful.\\nThe dress used for this purpose, consisted of a sort of thick cloak,\\ncovered with feathers, like those of the South Sea islands, and was so\\nfashioned, by means of a tight thick quilting, as to make the wearer, at\\na little distance, very much resemble an overgrown bird, except that the\\nlegs were somewhat too thick. Their arms were concealed under the wings;\\nand the resemblance was yet further increased, by marks with beaks adapted\\nto the particular plumage: some personating doves, some magpies; others\\nagain, hawks, parrots, &c., according to their natural figure, humour,\\n&c.; while the deception was still further assisted by their extraordinary\\nagility, compared with ours, by means of which they could, with ease,\\nhop eighteen or twenty feet. I told the Brahmin that some of the Indians\\nof our continent showed a similar taste in dress, by decorating themselves\\nwith horns like the buffalo, and with tails like horses; which furnished\\nhim with a further argument in favour of a common origin.\\n\\nWe spent above an hour in examining these curious habiliments, and in\\ninquiring the purposes and uses of the several parts. Sometimes I was\\ninduced, through the Brahmin, to criticise their taste and skill, having\\nbeen always an admirer of simplicity in female attire. But I remarked\\non this occasion, as on several others, subsequently, that the people of\\nthe moon were neither very thankful for advice, nor thought very highly\\nof the judgment of those who differ from them in opinion.\\n\\nAfter having rambled over the city about six hours, our appetites told\\nus it was time to return to our lodgings; and here I met with a new\\ncause of wonder. The family with whom we were domesticated, belonged\\nto a numerous and zealous sect of religionists, and were, in their way,\\nvery worthy, as well as pious people. Their dinner consisted of several\\ndishes of vegetables, variously served up; of roots, stalks, seeds,\\nflowers, and fruits, some of which resembled the productions of the\\nearth; and in particular, I saw a dish of what I at first took to be\\nvery fine asparagus, but supposed I was mistaken, when I saw them eat\\nthe coarse fibrous part alone. On tasting it, however, in the ordinary\\nway, I found it to be genuine, good asparagus; but I perceived that the\\nfamily looked extremely shocked at my taste. After the other dishes were\\nremoved, some large fruit, of the peach kind, were set on the table,\\nwhen the members of the family, having carefully paired off the skin,\\nate it, and threw the rest away. They in like manner chewed the shells\\nof some small grayish nuts, and threw away the kernels, which to me were\\nvery palatable. The younger children, consisting of two boys and a girl,\\nexchanged looks with each other at the selections I made, and I thought\\nI perceived in the looks of the mother, still more aversion than surprise.\\nI found too, that my friend the Brahmin abstained from all these things,\\nand partook only of those vegetables and fruits of which both they and I\\nate alike. Some wine was offered us, which appeared to me to be neither\\nmore nor less than vinegar; and, what added to my surprise, a bottle,\\nwhich they said was not yet fit to drink, seemed to me to be pretty good,\\nthe Brahmin having passed it to me for my judgment, as soon as they\\npronounced upon it sentence of condemnation.\\n\\nAfter we arose from this strange scene, and had withdrawn to our chamber,\\nI expressed my surprise to my companion at this contrariety in the tastes\\nof the Terrestrials and Lunarians: whereupon he told me, that the\\ndifference was rather apparent than real.\\n\\n\"These people,\" said he, \"belong to a sect of Ascetics in this country,\\nwho are persuaded that all pleasure received through the senses is sinful,\\nand that man never appears so acceptable in the sight of the Deity, as\\nwhen he rejects all the delicacies of the palate, as well as other\\nsensual gratifications, and imposes on himself that food to which he\\nfeels naturally most repugnant. You may see that those peaches, which\\nwere so disdainfully thrown into the yard, are often secretly picked up\\nby the children, who obey the impulses of nature, and devour them most\\ngreedily. Even in the old people themselves, there is occasionally some\\nbacksliding into the depravity of worldly appetite. You might have\\nperceived, that while the old man was abusing the wine you drank as\\nunripe, and making wry faces at it, he still kept tasting it; and if I\\nhad not reached it to you, he would probably, before he had ceased his\\nmeditations, have finished half the bottle. It must be confessed, that\\nalthough religion cherishes our best feelings, it also often proves a\\ncloak for the worst.\"\\n\\nI told him that our clergy were superior to this weakness, most of them\\nmanifesting a proper sense of the bounty of Providence, by eating and\\ndrinking of the best, (not very sparingly neither); and that in New-York,\\nwe considered some of our preachers the best judges of wine among us. Soon\\nafterwards, we again sallied forth in quest of adventures, and bent our\\ncourse towards the suburbs.\\n\\nWe had not gone far, before we saw several persons looking at a man\\nworking hard at a forge, in a low crazy building. On approaching him, we\\nfound he was engaged in making nails, an operation which he performed\\nwith great skill and adroitness; and as soon as he had made as many\\nas he could take up in his hand at once, he carried them behind his\\nlittle hovel, and dropped them into a narrow deep well. Some of the\\nby-standers wished to beg a few of what he seemed to value so lightly,\\nand others offered to give him bread or clothes in exchange for his\\nnails, but he obstinately resisted all their applications; in fact,\\nlittle heeding them, although he was almost naked, had a starved, haggard\\nappearance, and evidently regarded the food they proffered with a\\nwishful eye.\\n\\nThe lookers on told us the blacksmith had been for years engaged in this\\nbusiness of nail-making; he worked with little intermission, scarcely\\nallowing himself time for necessary sleep or refreshment; that all the\\nfruits of his incessant labour were disposed of in the manner we had\\njust seen; and that he had already three wells filled with nails, which\\nhe had carefully closed. He had, moreover, a large and productive farm,\\nthe increase arising from which, was laid out in exchange for the metal\\nof which his nails were made. He had, we were informed, so much attachment\\nto these pieces of metal, that he was often on the point of starvation\\nbefore he would part with one.\\n\\nI observed to the Brahmin, that it was a singular, and somewhat\\ninexplicable, species of madness.\\n\\n\"True,\" he replied; \"this man\\'s conduct cannot be explained upon any\\nrational principles--but he is one of the Glonglims, of which I have\\nspoken to you; and examples are not wanting on our planet, of conduct\\nas irreconcilable to reason. This man is making an article which is\\nscarce, as well as useful, in this country, where gravity is less than\\nit is with us: the force of the wind is very great, and the metal is\\npossessed but by a few. Now, if you suppose these nails to be pieces\\nof gold and silver, his conduct will be precisely that of some of our\\nmisers, who waste their days and nights in hoarding up wealth which they\\nnever use, nor mean to use; but, denying themselves every comfort of\\nlife, anxiously and unceasingly toil for those who are to come after\\nthem, though they are so far from feeling, towards these successors,\\nany peculiar affection, that they often regard them with jealousy and\\nhatred.\"\\n\\nWhile we thus conversed, there stepped up to us a handsome man, foppishly\\ndressed in blue trowsers, a pink vest, and a red and white turban; who,\\nafter having shaken my companion by the ears, according to the custom of\\nthe country among intimate friends, expressed his delight at seeing him\\nagain in Morosofia. He then went on, in a lively, humorous strain, to\\nridicule the nail-smith, and told us several stories of his singular\\nattachment to his nails. In the midst of these sallies, however, a harsh\\nlooking personage in brown came up, upon which the countenance of our\\nlively acquaintance suddenly changed, and they walked off together.\\n\\n\"I apprehend,\" said the Brahmin, \"that my gay acquaintance yonder\\ncontinues as he formerly was. The man in brown, who so unseasonably\\ninterrupted his pleasantry, is an officer of justice, and has probably\\ntaken him before a magistrate, to answer some one of his numerous\\ncreditors. You must know,\" added he, \"that the people of the moon,\\nhowever irrational themselves, are very prompt in perceiving the\\nabsurdities of others: and this lively wit, who, as you see, wants neither\\nparts nor address, acts as strangely as the wretch he has been ridiculing.\\nHe inherited a large estate, which brought him in a princely revenue;\\nand yet his desires and expenses so far outgo his means, that he is\\nalways in want. Both he and the nailmaker suffer the evils of poverty--\\nof poverty created by themselves--which, moreover, they can terminate\\nwhen they please; but they must reach the same point by directly opposite\\nroads. The blacksmith will allow himself nothing--the beau will deny\\nhimself nothing: the one is a slave to pleasure--the other, the victim\\nof fear. I told you that there were but few whose estates produced the\\nmetal of which these nails are made; and this thoughtless youth happens\\nto be one. A few years since, he wanted some of the blacksmith\\'s nails\\nto purchase the first rose of the season, and pledged his mines to pay,\\nat the end of the year, three times the amount he received in exchange;\\nand although, if he were to use but half his income for a single year,\\nthe other half would discharge his debts. I apprehend, from what I have\\nheard, that he has, from that time to this, continued to pay the same\\nexorbitant interest. When I was here before, I prevailed on him to take\\na ride with me into the country, and, under one pretext or another,\\ndetained him ten days at a friend\\'s house, where he had no inducement\\nto expense. When he returned, he found his debts paid off; but knowing\\nhe was master of so ready and effectual an expedient, he, the next day,\\nborrowed double the sum at the old rate. Since that time his debts have\\naccumulated so rapidly, that he will probably now be compelled to\\nsurrender his whole estate.\"\\n\\n\"Is he also a Glonglim?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Assuredly: what man, in his entire senses, could act so irrationally?\"\\n\\n\"There is nothing on earth that exceeds this,\" said I.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Brahmin; \"human folly is every where the same.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n_Physical peculiarities of the Moon-Celestial phenomena--Further\\ndescription of the Lunarians--National prejudice--Lightness of bodies--The\\nBrahmin carries Atterley to sup with a philosopher--His character and\\nopinions_.\\n\\n\\nAfter we had been in the moon about forty eight hours, the sun had sunk\\nbelow the horizon, and the long twilight of the Lunarians had begun. I will\\nhere take occasion to notice the physical peculiarities of this country,\\nwhich, though very familiar to those who are versed in astronomy, may not\\nbe unacceptable to the less scientific portion of my readers.\\n\\nThe sun is above the horizon nearly a fortnight, and below it as long; of\\ncourse the day here is equal to about twenty-seven of ours. The earth\\nanswers the same purpose to half the inhabitants of the moon, that the moon\\ndoes to the inhabitants of the earth. The face of the latter, however, is\\nmore than twelve times as large, and it has not the same silvery appearance\\nas the moon, but is rather of a dingy pink hue, like that of her iron when\\nbeginning to lose its red heat. As the same part of the moon is always\\nturned to the earth, one half of her surface is perpetually illuminated by\\na moon ten times as large to the eye as the sun; the other hemisphere is\\nwithout a moon. The favoured part, therefore, never experiences total\\ndarkness, the earth reflecting to the Lunarians as much light as we\\nterrestrials have a little before sunrise, or after sunset. But our planet\\npresents to the Lunarians the same changes as the moon does to us,\\naccording to its position in relation to the sun. It always, however,\\nappears to occupy nearly the same part of the heavens, when seen from the\\nsame point on the moon\\'s surface; but its altitude above the horizon is\\ngreater or less, according to the latitude of the place from which it is\\nseen: so that there is not a point of the heavens which the earth may not\\nbe seen permanently to occupy, according to the part of the moon from which\\nthe planet is viewed.\\n\\nFrom the length of time that the sun is above the horizon, the continued\\naction of his rays, in those climates where they fall vertically, or nearly\\nso, would be intolerable, if it was not for the high mountains, from whose\\nsnow-clad summits a perpetual breeze derives a refreshing coolness, and for\\nthe deep glens and recesses, in which most animals seek protection from his\\nmeridian beams. The transitions from heat to cold are less than one would\\nexpect, from the length of their days and nights--the coolness of the one,\\nas well as the heat of the other, being tempered by a constant east wind.\\nThe climate gradually becomes colder as we approach the Poles; but there is\\nlittle or no change of seasons in the same latitude.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of the moon have not the same regularity in their meals, or\\ntime for sleep, as we have, but consult their appetites and inclinations\\nlike other animals. But they make amends for this irregularity, by a very\\nstrict and punctilious observance of festivals, which are regulated by the\\nmotions of the sun, at whose rising and setting they have their appropriate\\nceremonies. Those which are kept at sunrise, are gay and cheerful, like the\\nhopes which the approach of that benignant luminary inspires. The others\\nare of a grave and sober character, as if to prepare the mind for serious\\ncontemplation in their long-enduring night. When the earth is at the full,\\nwhich is their midnight, it is also a season of great festivity with them.\\n\\n_Eclipses of the sun_ are as common with the Lunarians as those of the\\nmoon are with us--the same relative position of the three bodies producing\\nthis phenomenon; but an _eclipse of the earth_ never takes place, as\\nthe shadow of the moon passes over the broad disc of our planet, merely as\\na dark spot.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of the moon can always determine both their latitude and\\nlongitude, by observing the quarter of the heavens in which the earth is\\nseen: and, as the sun invariably appears of the same altitude at their\\nnoon, the inhabitants are denominated and classed according to the length\\nof their shadows; and the terms _long shadow_, or _short shadow_, are\\ncommon forms of national reproach among them, according to the relative\\nposition of the parties. I found the climate of those whose shadows are\\nabout the length of their own figure, the most agreeably to my own\\nfeelings, and most like that of my own country.\\n\\nSuch are the most striking natural appearances on one side of this\\nsatellite. On the other there is some difference. The sun pursues the same\\npath in the corresponding latitudes of both hemispheres; but being without\\nany moon, they have a dull and dreary night, though the light from the\\nstars is much greater than with us. The science of astronomy is much\\ncultivated by the inhabitants of the dark hemisphere, and is indebted to\\nthem for its most important discoveries, and its present high state of\\nimprovement.\\n\\nIf there is much rivalship among the natives of the same hemisphere, who\\ndiffer in the length of their shadows, they all unite in hatred and\\ncontempt for the inhabitants of the opposite side. Those who have the\\nbenefit of a moon, that is, who are turned towards the earth, are lively,\\nindolent, and changeable as the face of the luminary on which they pride\\nthemselves; while those on the other side are more grave, sedate, and\\nindustrious. The first are called the Hilliboos, and the last the\\nMoriboos--or bright nights, and dark nights. And this mutual animosity is\\nthe more remarkable, as they often appeared to me to be the same race, and\\nto differ much less from one another than the natives of different\\nclimates. It is true, that enlightened and well educated men do not seem to\\nfeel this prejudice, or at least they do not show it: but those who travel\\nfrom one hemisphere to the other, are sure to encounter the prejudices of\\nthe vulgar, and are often treated with great contempt and indignity. They\\nare pointed at by the children, who, according as they chance to have been\\nbred on one side or the other say, \"There goes a man who never saw\\nGlootin,\" as they call the earth; or, \"There goes a Booblimak,\" which means\\na night stroller.\\n\\nAll bodies are much lighter on the moon than on the earth; by reason of\\nwhich circumstance, as has been mentioned, the inhabitants are more active,\\nand experience much less fatigue in ascending their precipitous mountains.\\nI was astonished at first at this seeming increase in my muscular powers;\\nwhen, on passing along a street in Alamatua, soon after my arrival, and\\nmeeting a dog, which I thought to be mad, I proposed to run out of his way,\\nand in leaping over a gutter, I fairly bounded across the street. I\\nmeasured the distance the next day, and found it to be twenty-seven feet\\nfive inches; and afterwards frequently saw the school-boys, when engaged in\\nathletic exercises, make running leaps of between thirty and forty feet,\\nbackwards and forwards. Another consequence of the diminished gravity here\\nis, that both men and animals carry much greater burdens than on the earth.\\n\\nThe carriages are drawn altogether by dogs, which are the largest animals\\nthey have, except the zebra, and a small buffalo. This diminution of\\ngravity is, however, of some disadvantage to them. Many of their tools are\\nnot as efficient as ours, especially their axes, hoes, and hammers. On the\\nother hand, when a person falls to the ground, it is nearly the same thing\\nas if an inhabitant of the earth were to fall on a feather bed. Yet I saw\\nas many instances of fractured limbs, hernia, and other accidents there, as\\nI ever saw on the earth; for when they fall from great heights, or miscarry\\nin the feats of activity which they ambitiously attempt, it inflicts the\\nsame injury upon them, as a fall nearer the ground does upon us.\\n\\nAfter we had been here sufficiently long to see what was most remarkable in\\nthe city, and I had committed the fruit of my observations to paper, the\\nBrahmin proposed to carry me to one of the monthly suppers of a philosopher\\nwhom he knew, and who had obtained great celebrity by his writings and\\nopinions.\\n\\nWe accordingly went, and found him sitting at a small table, and apparently\\nexhausted with the labour of composition, and the ardour of intense\\nthought. He was a small man, of quick, abrupt manners, occasionally very\\nabstracted, but more frequently voluble, earnest, and disputatious. He\\nfrankly told us he was sorry to see us, as he was then putting the last\\nfinish to a great and useful work he was about to publish: that we had thus\\nunseasonably broken the current of his thoughts, and he might not be able\\nto revive it for some days. Upon my rising to take my leave, he assured me\\nthat it would be adding to the injury already done, if we then quitted him.\\nHe said he wished to learn the particulars of our voyage; and that he, in\\nturn, should certainly render us service, by disclosing some of the results\\nof his own reflections. He further remarked, that he expected six or eight\\nfriends--that is, (correcting himself,) \"enlightened and congenial minds,\"\\nto supper, on the rising of a constellation he named, which time, he\\nremarked, would soon arrive. Finding his frankness to be thus seasoned with\\nhospitality, we resumed our seats. It soon appeared that he was more\\ndisposed to communicate information than to seek it; and I became a patient\\nlistener. If the boldness and strangeness of his opinions occasionally\\nstartled me, I could not but admire the clearness with which he stated his\\npropositions, the fervour of his elocution, and the plausibility of his\\narguments.\\n\\nThe expected guests at length arrived; and various questions of morals and\\nlegislation were started, in which the disputants seemed sometimes as if\\nthey would have laid aside the character of philosophers, but for the\\nseasonable interposition of the Brahmin. Wigurd, our host, often laboured\\nwith his accustomed zeal, to prove that every one who opposed him, was\\neither a fool, or biassed by some petty interest, or the dupe of blind\\nprejudice.\\n\\nAfter about two hours of warm, and, as it seemed to me, unprofitable\\ndiscussion, we were summoned to our repast in the adjoining room. But\\nbefore we rose from our seats, our host requested to know of each of us if\\nwe were hungry; and, whether it were from modesty, perverseness, or really\\nbecause they had no appetite, I know not, but a majority of the company, in\\nwhich I was included, voted that their hour of eating was not yet come:\\nupon which Wigurd remarked that his own vote, as being at home, and the\\nBrahmin\\'s, as being at once a philosopher and a stranger, should each count\\nfor two; and by this mode of reckoning there was a casting vote in favour\\nof going to supper.\\n\\nWe found the table covered with tempting dishes, served up in a costly and\\ntasteful style, and a sprightly, well-looking female prepared to do the\\nhonours of the feast. She reproved our host for his delay, and told him the\\nbest dish was spoiled, by being cold. I was fearful of a discussion; but he\\nsat down without making a reply, and immediately addressing the company,\\ndescanted on the various qualities of food, and their several adaptations\\nto different ages, constitutions, and temperaments. He condemned the absurd\\npractice which prevailed, for the master or mistress of the house to lavish\\nentreaties on their guests to eat that which they might be better without;\\nand insisted, at the same time, that the guests ought not to consult their\\nown tastes exclusively. He maintained, that the only course worthy of\\nrational and benevolent beings, was for every man to judge for his\\nneighbour as well as for himself; and, should any collision arise between\\nthe different claimants, then, if any one were guided by that decision,\\nwhich an honest and unbiassed judgment would tell him was right, they would\\nall come to the same just and harmonious result.\\n\\n\"But,\" added he, \"you have not yet been sufficiently prepared for this\\ndisinterested operation. As ye have proved this night that ye are not yet\\npurged of the feelings and prejudices of a vicious education, I will\\nperform this office for you all, and set you an example, by which ye may\\nhereafter profit. To begin, then, with you--(addressing himself to a\\ncorpulent man, of a florid complexion, at the lower end of the table:)--As\\nyou already have a redundancy of flesh and blood, I assign the _soupe\\nmaigre_ to you; while to our mathematical friend on this side, whose\\ndelicate constitution requires nourishment, I recommend the smoking ragout.\\nThis cooling dish will suit your temperament,\" said he to a third; \"and\\nthis stimulating one, yours,\" to a fourth. \"Those little birds, which cost\\nme five pieces, I shall divide between my terrestrial friend here (looking\\nat the Brahmin) and myself, we being the most meritorious of the company,\\nand it being of the utmost importance to society, that food so wholesome\\nshould give nourishment to our bodies, and impart vigour and vivacity to\\nour minds.\"\\n\\nFrom this decision there was no appeal, and no other dissent than what was\\nexpressed by a look or a low murmur. But I perceived the corpulent\\ngentleman and the wan mathematician slily exchange their dishes, by which\\nthey both seemed to consider themselves gainers. The dish allotted to me,\\nbeing of a middling character, I ate of it without repining; though, from\\nthe savoury fumes of my right-hand neighbour\\'s plate, I could not help\\nwishing I had been allowed to choose for myself.\\n\\nThis supper happening near the middle of the night, (at which time it was\\nalways pretty cool,) a cheerful fire blazed in one side of the room and I\\nperceived that our host and hostess placed themselves so as to be at the\\nmost agreeable distance, the greater part of the guests being either too\\nnear or too far from it.\\n\\nAfter we had finished our repast, various subjects of speculation were\\nagain introduced and discussed, greatly to my amusement. Wigurd displayed\\nhis usual ingenuity and ardour, and baffled all his antagonists by his\\nvehemence and fluency. He had two great principles by which he tested the\\ngood or evil of every thing; and there were few questions in which he could\\nnot avail himself of one or the other. These were, general _utility_\\nand _truth_.\\n\\nBy a skilful use of these weapons of controversy, he could attack or defend\\nwith equal success. If any custom or institution which he had denounced,\\nwas justified by his adversaries, on the ground of its expediency, he\\nimmediately retorted on them its repugnancy to sincerity, truth, and\\nunsophisticated nature; and if they, at any time, resorted to a similar\\njustification for our natural feelings and propensities, he triumphantly\\nshowed that they were inimical to the public good. Thus, he condemned\\ngratitude as a sentiment calculated to weaken the sense of justice, and to\\nsubstitute feeling for reason. He, on the other hand, proscribed the little\\nforms and courtesies, which are either founded in convenience, or give a\\ngrace and sweetness to social intercourse, as a direct violation of honest\\nnature, and therefore odious and mean. He thus was able to silence every\\nopponent. I was very desirous of hearing the Brahmin\\'s opinion; but, while\\nhe evidently was not convinced by our host\\'s language, he declined engaging\\nin any controversy.\\n\\nAfter we retired, my friend told me that Wigurd was a good man in the main,\\nthough he had been as much hated by some as if his conduct had been\\nimmoral, instead of his opinions merely being singular. \"He not long ago,\"\\nadded the Brahmin \"wrote a book against marriage, and soon afterwards\\nwedded, in due form, the lady you saw at his table. She holds as strange\\ntenets as he, which she supports with as much zeal, and almost as much\\nability. But I predict that the popularity of their doctrines will not\\nlast; and if ever you visit the moon again, you will find that their glory,\\nnow at its height, like the ephemeral fashions of the earth, will have\\npassed away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n_A celebrated physician: his ingenious theories in physics: his mechanical\\ninventions--The feather-hunting Glonglim._\\n\\n\\nOn returning to our lodgings, we, acting under the influence of long habit,\\nwent to bed, though half the family were up, and engaged in their ordinary\\nemployments. One consequence of the length of the days and nights here is,\\nthat every household is commonly divided into two parts, which watch and\\nsleep by turns: nor have they any uniformity in their meals, except in\\nparticular families, which are regulated by clocks and time-pieces. The\\nvulgar have no means of measuring smaller portions of time than a day or\\nnight, (each equal to a fortnight with us,) except by observing the\\napparent motion of the sun or the stars, in which, considering that it is\\nnearly thirty times as slow as with us, they attain surprising accuracy.\\nThey have the same short intervals of labour and rest in their long night\\nas their day--the light reflected from the earth, being commonly sufficient\\nto enable them to perform almost any operation; and, ere our planet is in\\nher second quarter, one may read the smallest print by her light.\\n\\nTo compensate their want of this natural advantage, the inhabitants of\\nMoriboozia are abundantly supplied with a petroleum, or bituminous liquid,\\nwhich is found every where about their lakes, or on their mountains, and\\nwhich they burn in lamps, of various sizes, shapes, and constructions. They\\nhave also numerous volcanoes, each of which sheds a strong light for many\\nmiles around.\\n\\nWe slept unusually long; and, owing in part to Wigurd\\'s good cheer, I awoke\\nwith a head-ache. I got up to take a long walk, which often relieves me\\nwhen suffering from that malady; and, on ascending the stairs, I met our\\nlandlord\\'s eldest daughter, a tall, graceful girl of twenty. I found she\\nwas coming down backwards, which I took to be a mere girlish freak, or\\nperhaps a piece of coquetry, practised on myself: but I afterwards found,\\nthat about the time the earth is at the full, the whole family pursued the\\nsame course, and were very scrupulous in making their steps in this awkward\\nand inconvenient way, because it was one of the prescribed forms of their\\nchurch.\\n\\nAs my head-ache became rather worse, than better, from my walk, the Brahmin\\nproposed to accompany me to the house of a celebrated physician, called\\nVindar, who was also a botanist, chemist, and dentist, to consult him on my\\ncase; and thither we forthwith proceeded. I found him a large, unwieldy\\nfigure, of a dull, heavy look, but by no means deficient in science or\\nnatural shrewdness. He confirmed my previous impression that I ought to\\nlose blood, and plausibly enough accounted for my present sensation of\\nfulness, from the inferior pressure of the lunar atmosphere to that which I\\nhad been accustomed. He proposed, however, to return to my veins a portion\\nof thinner blood in place of what he should take away, and offered me the\\nchoice of several animals, which he always kept by him for that purpose.\\nThere were two white animals of the hog kind, a male and a female lama,\\nthree goats, besides several birds, about the size of a turkey, some\\ntortoises, and other amphibious animals. He professed himself willing, in\\ncase I had any foolish scruples against mixing my blood with that of\\nbrutes, to purify my own, and put it back; but I obstinately declined both\\nexpedients; whereupon he opened a vein in my arm, and took from it about\\nfourteen ounces of blood. Finding myself, weakened as well as relieved, by\\nthe operation, he invited me to rest myself; and while I was recovering my\\nstrength, he discoursed with the Brahmin and myself on several of his\\nfavourite topics. On returning home, I committed to paper some of the most\\nremarkable of his opinions, which it may be as well to notice, that those\\nwho have since propounded, or may hereafter propound, the same to the\\nworld, may not claim the merit of originality.\\n\\nHe maintained that the number of our senses was greater than that commonly\\nassigned to us. That we had, for example, a sense of acids, of alkalies, of\\nweight, and of heat. That acid substances acted upon our bodies by a\\npeculiar set of nerves, or through some medium of their own, was evident\\nfrom this, that they set the teeth on edge, though these, from their hard\\nand bony nature, are insensible to the touch. That astringents shrivelled\\nup the flesh and puckered the mouth, even when their taste was not\\nperceived. That when the skin shrunk on the application of vinegar, could\\nit be said that it had not a peculiar sense of this liquid, or rather of\\nits acidity, since the existence of the senses was known only by effects\\nwhich external matter produced on them? That the senses, like that of\\ntouch, were seated in most parts of the body, but were most acute in the\\nmouth, nose, ears, and eyes. He showed some disposition to maintain the\\npopular notions of the Greeks and Romans, that the rivers and streams are\\nendowed with reason and volition; and endeavoured to prove that some of\\ntheir windings and deviations from a straight line, cannot be explained\\nupon mechanical principles.\\n\\nVindar is, moreover, a projector of a very bold character; and not long ago\\npetitioned the commanding general of an army, suddenly raised to repel an\\nincursion of one of their neighbours, to march his troops into\\nGoolo-Tongtoia, for the purpose of digging a canal from one of their\\npetroleum lakes into Morosofia, and conducting it, by smaller streams, over\\nthat country, for the purpose of warming it during their long cool nights.\\n\\nHe has, too, a large grist and saw mill, which are put in motion by the\\nexplosion of gunpowder. This is conveyed, by a sufficiently ingenious\\nmachine, in very small portions, to the bottom of an upright cylinder,\\nwhich is immediately shut perfectly close. A flint and steel are at the\\nsame time made to strike directly over it, and to ignite the powder. The\\nair that is thus generated, forces up a piston through a cylinder, which\\npiston, striking the arm of a wheel, puts it in motion, and with it the\\nmachinery of the mills. A complete revolution of the wheel again prepares\\nthe cylinder for a fresh supply of gunpowder, which is set on fire, and\\nproduces the same effect as before.\\n\\nHe told me he had been fifteen years perfecting this great work, in which\\ntime it had been twice blown up by accidents, arising from the carelessness\\nor mismanagement of the workmen; but that he now expected it would repay\\nhim for the time and money he had expended. He had once, he said, intended\\nto use the expansive force of congelation for his moving power; but he\\nfound, after making a full and accurate calculation, that the labourers\\nrequired to keep the machine supplied with ice, consumed something more\\nthan twice as much corn as the mill would grind in the same time. He then\\nwas about to move it to a fine stream of water in the neighbourhood, which,\\nby being dammed up, so as to form a large pond, would afford him a\\nconvenient and inexhaustible supply of ice. But the millwright, after the\\ndam was completed, having artfully obtained his permission to use the waste\\nwater, and fraudulently erected there a common water-mill, which soon\\nobtained all the neighbouring custom, he had sold out that property, and\\nresorted to the agency of gunpowder, which is quite as philosophical a\\nprocess as that of congelation, and much less expensive. In answer to an\\ninquiry of the Brahmin\\'s, he admitted, that though he had been able, by the\\nforce of congelation, to burst metallic tubes several inches thick, he had\\nnever succeeded in making it put the lightest machinery into a continued\\nmotion.\\n\\nHaving now nearly recovered, and being, I confess, somewhat bewildered by\\nthe variety and complexity of these ingenious projects, I felt disposed to\\ntake my leave; but Vindar insisted on conducting us into an inner\\napartment, to see his _poetry box_. This was a large piece of furniture,\\nprofusely decorated with metals of various colours, curiously and\\nfantastically inlaid. It contained a prodigious number of drawers,\\nwhich were labelled after the manner of those in an apothecary\\'s shop,\\n(from whence he denied, however, that he first took the hint,) and the\\nlabels were arranged in alphabetical order.\\n\\n\"Now,\" says he, \"as the excellence of poetry consists in bringing before\\nthe mind\\'s eye what can be brought before the corporeal eye, I have here\\ncollected every object that is either beautiful or pleasing in nature,\\nwhether by its form, colour, fragrance, sweetness, or other quality, as\\nwell as those that are strikingly disagreeable. When I wish to exhibit\\nthose pictures which constitute poetry, I consult the appropriate cabinet,\\nand I take my choice of those various substances which can best call up the\\nimage I wish to present to my reader. For example: suppose I wish to speak\\nof any object that is white, or analogous to white, I open the drawer that\\nis thus labelled, and I see silver, lime, chalk, and white enamel, ivory,\\npaper, snow-drops, and alabaster, and select whichever of these substances\\nwill best suit the measure and the rhyme, and has the most soft-sounding\\nname. If the colour be yellow, then there are substances of all shades of\\nthis hue, from saffron and pickled salmon to brimstone and straw. I have\\nsixty-two red substances, twenty-seven green ones, and others in the same\\nproportion. It is astonishing what labour this box has saved me, and how\\nmuch it has added to the beauty and melody of my verse.\\n\\n\"You perceive,\" he added, \"the drawer missing. That contained substances\\noffensive to the sight or smell, which my maid, conducted to it by her\\nnose, conceived to be some animal curiosities I had been collecting, in a\\nstate of putrefaction and decay, and did not hesitate to throw them into\\nthe fire. I afterwards found myself very much at a loss, whenever my\\nsubject led me to the mention of objects of this character, and I therefore\\nspoke of them as seldom as possible.\" After bestowing that tribute of\\nadmiration and praise which every great author or inventor expects, in his\\nown house, and not omitting his customary medical fee, we took our leave.\\n\\nWe had not long left Vindar\\'s house, before we saw a short fat man in the\\nsuburbs, preparing to climb to the top of a plane tree, on which there was\\none of the tail feathers of a sort of flamingo. He was surrounded by\\nattendants and servants, to whom he issued his commands with great rapidity\\nand decision, occasionally intermingling with his orders the most\\nthreatening language and furious gesticulations. Some offered to get a\\nladder, and ascend, and others to cut down the tree; all of which he\\nobstinately rejected. He swore he would get the feather--he would get it by\\nclimbing--and he would climb but one way, which way was on the shoulders of\\nhis men. His plan was to make a number of them form a solid square, and\\ninterlock their arms; then a smaller number to mount upon their shoulders,\\non whom others were in like manner placed, and so on till the pyramid was\\nsufficiently high, when he himself was to mount, and from the shoulders of\\nthe highest pluck the darling object of his wishes. He had in this way, I\\nafterwards learnt, gathered some of the richest flowers of the bignonia\\nscarlatina, as well as such fruits as had tempted him by their luscious\\nappearance, and at the same time frightening all the birds from their\\nnests, which he commonly destroyed: and although some of his attendants\\nwere occasionally much hurt and bruised in this singular amusement, he\\nstill persevered in it. He had continued it for several years, with no\\nintermission, except a short one, when he was engaged in breaking a young\\nllana in the place of an old one, which had been many years a favourite,\\nbut was now in disgrace, because, as he said, he did not think it so safe\\nfor going down hill, but in reality, because he liked the figure and\\nmovements of the young one better.\\n\\nI could not see this rash Glonglim attempt to climb that dangerous ladder,\\nwithout feeling alarm for his safety. At first all seemed to go on very\\nwell; but just as he was about to lay hold of the gaudy prize, there arose\\na sudden squall, which threw both him and his supporters into confusion,\\nand the whole living pyramid came to the ground together. Many were\\nkilled--some were wounded and bruised. Polenap himself, by lighting on his\\nmen, who served him as cushions, barely escaped with life. But he received\\na fracture in the upper part of his head, and a dislocation of the hip,\\nwhich will not only prevent him from ever climbing again, but probably make\\nhim a cripple for life.\\n\\nThe Brahmin and I endeavoured to give the sufferers some assistance; but\\nthis was rendered unnecessary, by the crowd which their cries and\\nlamentations brought to their relief. I thought that the author of so much\\nmischief would have been stoned on the spot; but, to my surprise, his\\nservants seemed to feel as much for his honour as their own safety, and\\nwarmly interfered in his behalf, until they had somewhat appeased the rage\\nof the surrounding multitude.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n_The fortune-telling philosopher, who inspected the finger nails: his\\nvisiters--Another philosopher, who judged of the character by the\\nhair--The fortune-teller duped--Predatory warfare._\\n\\n\\nAs we returned to our lodgings, we saw a number of persons, some of whom\\nwere entering and some leaving a neat small dwelling; and on joining the\\nthrong, we learnt that a famous fortune-teller lived there, who, at\\nstated periods, opened his house to all that were willing to pay for\\nbeing instructed in the events of futurity, or for having the secrets of\\nthe present or past revealed to them. On entering the house, and\\ndescending a flight of steps, we found, at the farther end of a dark\\nroom, lighted with a chandelier suspended from the ceiling, an elderly\\nman, with a long gray beard, and a thin, pale countenance, deeply\\nfurrowed with thought rather than care. He received us politely, and\\nthen resumed the duties of his vocation. His course of proceeding was to\\nexamine the finger nails, and, according to their form, colour,\\nthickness, surface, and grain, to determine the character and destinies\\nof those who consulted him. I was at once pleased and surprised at the\\nminuteness of his observation, and the infinite variety of his\\ndistinctions. Besides the qualities of the nails that I have mentioned,\\nhe noticed some which altogether eluded my senses, such as their\\nmilkiness, flintiness, friability, elasticity, tenacity, and\\nsensibility; whether they were aqueous, unctious, or mealy; with many\\nmore, which have escaped my recollection.\\n\\nA modest, pensive looking girl, apparently about seventeen, was timidly\\nholding forth her hand for examination, at the time we entered.\\nAvarabet, (for that was the name of this philosopher,) uttered two or\\nthree words, with a significant shake of his head, upon which I saw the\\nrising tear in her eyes. She withdrew her hand, and had not courage to\\nlet him take another look.\\n\\nA fat woman, of a sanguine temperament, holding a little girl by the\\nhand, then stepped up and showed her fingers. He pronounced her amorous,\\ninconstant, prone to anger, and extravagant; that she had made one man\\nmiserable, and would probably make another. She also abruptly withdrew,\\ngiving manifest signs of one of the qualities ascribed to her.\\n\\nAn elderly matron then approached, holding forth one trembling, palsied\\nhand, with a small volume in the other. Avarabet hesitated for some\\ntime; examined the edges as well as the surface of the nails; drew his\\nfinger slowly over them, and then said,--\"You have a susceptible heart;\\nyou are in sorrow, but your affliction will soon have an end.\" It was\\neasy to see, in the look of the applicant, signs of pious resignation,\\nand a lively hope of another and a better state of existence.\\n\\nI thought I perceived in the scene that was passing before us, an\\nexhibition that is not uncommon on our earth, of cunning knavery\\nimposing on ignorance and credulity; and I expressed my opinion to the\\nBrahmin; but he assured me that the class of persons in the moon, who\\nwere resorted to on account of their supposed powers of divination, was\\nvery different from the similar class in Asia or Europe, and that\\noracular art was here regularly studied and professed as a branch of\\nphilosophy. \"You would be surprised,\" said he, \"to find how successful\\nthey have been in investing their craft with the forms and trappings of\\nscience, the parade of classification, and the mystery imparted by\\ntechnical terms. By these means they have given plausibility enough to\\ntheir theories, to leave many a one in doubt, whether it is really a new\\ntriumph of human discovery, or merely a later form of empiricism. Its\\nprofessors are commonly converts to their own theories, at least in a\\ngreat degree; for, strange as it may seem, there can mingle with the\\ndisposition to deceive others, the power of deceiving one\\'s self; and\\nwhile they exercise much acuteness and penetration in discovering, by\\nthe air, look, dress, and manner of those who consult them, the leading\\npoints in the history or character of persons of whom they have no\\nprevious knowledge, they at the same time persuade themselves that they\\nsee something indicative of their circumstances in their finger nails.\\nSuch is the equivocal character of the greater part of their sect: but\\nthere are some who are mere honest dupes to the pretensions of the\\nscience; and others again, who have not one tittle of credulity to\\nextenuate their impudent pretensions.\\n\\n\"When I was here before, I remember a physician, who acquired great\\ncelebrity by affecting to cure diseases by examining a lock of the\\npatient\\'s hair; and, not content with merely pronouncing on the nature\\nof the disease, and suggesting the remedy, he would enter into an\\nelaborate, and often plausible course of reasoning, in defence of his\\nsystem. That system was briefly this: that the hair derived its length,\\nstrength, hue, and other properties, from the brain; which opinion he\\nsupported by a reference to acknowledged facts--as, that it changes its\\nhue with the difference of the mental character in the different stages\\nof life; that violent affections of the mind, such as grief or fear,\\nhave been known to change it in a single night. Science on this, as on\\nother occasions, is merely augmenting and methodizing facts that the\\nmass of mankind had long observed--as, that red hair had always been\\nconsidered indicative of warm temperament; that affliction, and even\\nlove, were believed to create baldness; and that in great terror, the\\nhair stands on end. The different ages too, are distinguished as much by\\ntheir hair as their complexion, their facial angle, or in any other way.\\nHe was led to this theory first, by observing at school that a boy of a\\nstiff, bristly head of hair, was remarkably cruel. He professed to have\\nbeen able, from a long course of observation, to assign to every\\ndifferent colour and variety of hair, its peculiar temperament and\\ncharacter. One mental quality was indicated by its length, another by\\nits fineness, and others again as it chanced to be greasy, or lank, or\\ncurled. He would also blow on it with a bellows, to see how the parts\\narranged themselves: hold it near the fire, and watch the operation of\\nits crisping by the heat: and although he had often been mistaken in his\\nestimates of character, by the rules of his new science, he did not lose\\nthe confidence of his disciples on that account--some of them refusing\\nto believe the truth, rather than to admit themselves mistaken; and\\nothers insisting that, if his science was not infallible, it very rarely\\ndeceived.\"\\n\\nIt was now our turn to submit our hands to Avarabet for examination. He\\ndiscovered signs of the loftiest virtues and most heroic enterprise in\\nthe Brahmin; and, near the bottom of one of his nails, a deep-rooted\\nsorrow, which would leave him only with his life. A transient shade of\\ngloom on the Brahmin\\'s countenance was soon succeeded by a piercing,\\ninquisitive glance cast on the diviner. He saw the other\\'s eyes directed\\non the miniature which he always wore, and which discovered itself to\\nAvarabet as he stooped forward. A smile of contempt now took the place\\nof his first surprise, and he seemed in a state of abstraction, during\\nthe continued rhapsodies of the oracle.\\n\\nMy hand was next examined; but little was said of me, except that I had\\nbeen a great traveller, and should be so again; that I should encounter\\nmany dangers and difficulties; that I possessed more intelligence than\\nsensibility, and more prudence than generosity. Thus he discovered in me\\ngreat courage, enterprise, and constancy of purpose.\\n\\nA hale, robust, well-set man, now bursting through the crowd, and\\nthrusting out his hand, abruptly asked the wise man to tell him, if he\\ncould, in what part of the country he lived. Avarabet mentioned a\\ndistant district on the coast of Morosofia.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said the other; \"and what is my calling?\"\\n\\nAfter a slight pause, he replied, that he got his living on the water.\\n\\n\"Good again. Shall I ever be rich?\"\\n\\n\"No, not very:--never.\"\\n\\n\"Better and better,\" rejoined the inquirer, at the same time giving vent\\nto a loud and hearty laugh. Surely, thought I, sailors are every where\\nthe same sort of beings, rough and boisterous as the elements they\\nroam over.\\n\\n\"And what is your opinion of me farther?\"\\n\\n\"You are bold, frank, improvident, credulous and good-natured.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent, indeed! Now, what will you say, old sham wisdom, when I tell\\nyou that I never made a voyage in my life; was never two days\\' journey\\nfrom this spot, and am seldom off my own dominion? That I own the forest\\nof Tongloo, where I sometimes hunt, from morning till night, and from\\nnight till morning, twelve out of the thirteen days in the year? That my\\nwealth, which was considerable when I came to my estate, has, by my\\nhabits of life, greatly increased, and that I am bent upon adding to it\\nyet more? I drink nothing but water; and have come here only to win a\\nwager, that you were not as knowing as you pretended to be, and that I\\ncould impose on you. You thus have a specimen of my candour,\\nimprovidence, and credulity.\" So saying, he leaped on his zebra, gave a\\nsort of huntsman\\'s shout, and was off in a twinkling.\\n\\nThis adventure created great tumult in the crowd, a few enjoying the\\njest, but the greater number manifesting ill-will and resentment towards\\nthe sportsman. The Brahmin and I took advantage of the confusion, to\\nwithdraw unnoticed by the bystanders. After remaining at our lodgings\\nlong enough to take rest and refreshment, and to make minutes of what we\\nhad seen, we proposed to spend the remainder of the night in the\\ncountry, the weather being more pleasant at this time in that climate,\\nthan when the sun is above the horizon.\\n\\nWe accordingly set out when the earth was in her second quarter, and it\\nwas about two of our days before sunrise. After walking about three\\nmiles, the freshness of the morning air, the fragrance of the flowers,\\nand the music of innumerable birds, whose unceasing carols testified\\ntheir joy and delight at the approach of a more genial month, we came to\\na large, well cultivated farm, in which a number of coarse looking men\\nwere employed, with the aid of dogs, cross-bows, and other martial\\nweapons, in hunting down llamas, and a small kind of buffalo, which, in\\none of our former walks, we had seen quietly feeding on a rich and\\nextensive pasture. We inquired of some stragglers from the throng, the\\nmeaning of what we saw; but they were too much occupied with their sport\\nto afford us any satisfaction. We walked on, indulging our imaginations\\nin conjecture; but had not proceeded more than a quarter of a mile,\\nbefore we beheld a similar scene going on to our left, by the same\\nill-looking crew. Our curiosity was now redoubled, and we resolved to\\nwait a while on the highway, for the chance of some passenger more at\\nleisure to answer our inquiries, and more courteously inclined than\\nthese fierce marauders. We had not stopped many minutes, before a\\nwell-dressed man, wearing the appearance of authority, having ridden up,\\nwe asked him to explain the cause of their violent, and seemingly\\nlawless proceedings.\\n\\n\"You are strangers, I see, or you would have understood that I am\\nexercising my baronial privilege of doing myself justice. These cattle\\nbelong to the owners of a neighbouring estate, by whom I and my tenants\\nhave been injured and insulted; and, according to the usage in such\\ncases, I have given the signal to my people to lay hold on what they can\\nof his flocks and herds, and, to quicken their exertions, I give them\\nhalf of what they catch.\"\\n\\n\"And how does your neighbour bear this in the mean time?\" said the\\nBrahmin.\\n\\n\"Oh, for that matter,\" said the other, \"he is not at all behindhand, and\\nI lose nearly as many cattle as I get. But it gives me much more\\npleasure to kill one of his buffaloes or llamas, than it does pain me\\nwhen he kills one of mine. I consider how much it will vex him, and that\\nsome of his vassals are thereby deprived of their sustenance. I have\\nupwards of thirty strong men employed in ranging this plain and wood,\\nand during the last year they took for me four hundred head.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!--and how many did you lose in the same time?\\n\\n\"Not above three hundred and eighty.\"\\n\\n\"But very inferior?\" said the Brahmin.\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" replied he: \"as my pastures are richer and more luxuriant\\nthan his, two of my cattle are worth perhaps three of his.\"\\n\\n\"Is this custom,\" asked the Brahmin, \"an advantage or a tax on your\\nestate?\"\\n\\n\"A tax, indeed! Why it is worth from four to five hundred head a-year.\"\\n\\n\"And how much is it worth to your neighbour?\"\\n\\n\"I presume nearly as much.\"\\n\\n\"Do your vassals get rich by the bounty you give them?\"\\n\\n\"As to that matter, some who are lucky succeed very well, and the rest\\nmake a living by it.\"\\n\\n\"And what do they give you for the privilege of hunting your neighbour\\'s\\ncattle?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all: I even lose my customary rent from those who engage in\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"And it is the same case with your neighbour?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the Brahmin, \"it seems to me, if you would agree to lay\\naside this old custom, you would both be considerable gainers. I see you\\nlook incredulous, but listen a moment. Each one would, in that case,\\ninstead of having half his neighbour\\'s cattle, have all his own; and,\\nbeing kept in their native pastures, they would be less likely to stray\\naway, and you could therefore slay and eat as you wanted them; whereas,\\nin your hunting matches many more are either killed or maimed than are\\nwanted for present use, and they are consequently consumed in waste. You\\nwould, moreover, be a gainer by the amount of the labour of these thirty\\nboors, whom you keep in this employment, and who very probably acquire\\nhabits of ferocity, licentiousness, and waste, which are not very\\nfavourable to their obedience or fidelity.\"\\n\\nThe proprietor, having pondered a while upon my friend\\'s remarks, in a\\ntone of exultation said,--\"Do you think, then, I could ever prevail on\\nmy people to forbear, when they saw a likely flock, from laying violent\\nhands on it; or could I resist so favourable an opportunity of revenge?\\nNay, more; if we were then tamely to tie up our hands, do you think that\\nBulderent and his men would consent to do the same? No, no, old man,\" he\\ncontinued, with great self-complacency, \"your arguments appear plausible\\nat first, but when closely considered, they will not stand the lest of\\nexperience. They are the fancies of a stranger--of one who knows more of\\ntheory than practice. Had you lived longer among us, you would have\\nknown that your ingenious project could never be carried into execution.\\nIf I observed it, Bulderent would not; and if he observed it, I verily\\nbelieve I could not--and thus, you see, the thing is altogether\\nimpracticable.\" As one soon tires of preaching to the winds, the Brahmin\\ncontented himself with asking his new acquaintance to think more on the\\nsubject at his leisure; and we proceeded on our walk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n_The travellers visit a gentleman farmer, who is a great projector: his\\nbreed of cattle: his apparatus for cooking: he is taken\\ndangerously ill._\\n\\n\\nAfter we had gone about half a mile farther, our attention was arrested\\nby a gate of very singular character. It was extremely ingenious in its\\nstructure, and, among other peculiarities, it had three or four latches,\\nfor children, for grown persons, for those who were tall and those who\\nwere short, and for the right hand as well as the left. In the act of\\nopening, it was made to crush certain berries, and the oil they yielded,\\nwas carried by a small duct to the hinge, which was thus made to turn\\neasily, and was prevented from creaking. While we were admiring its\\nmechanism, an elderly man, rather plainly dressed, on a zebra in low\\ncondition, rode up, and showed that he was the owner of the mansion to\\nwhich the gate belonged, and that he was not displeased with the\\ncuriosity we manifested. We found him both intelligent and obliging. He\\ninformed us that he was an experimental farmer; and when he learnt that\\nwe were strangers, and anxious to inform ourselves of the state of\\nagriculture in the country, he very civilly invited us to take our next\\nmeal with him. Our walk having now made us hungry and fatigued, we\\ngladly accepted of his hospitality; whereupon he alighted, and walked\\nwith us to his lodgings.\\n\\nHe was very communicative of his modes of cultivation and management,\\nbut chiefly prided himself on his success in improving the size of his\\ncattle. He informed us that he had devoted sixteen years of his life to\\nthis object, and had then in his farm-yard a buffalo nearly as heavy as\\nthree of the ordinary size. His practice was to kill all the young\\nanimals which were not uncommonly large and thrifty; to cram those he\\nkept, with as much food as they would eat, and to tempt their appetites\\nby the variety of their nourishment, as well as of the modes of\\npreparing it.\\n\\n\"All this,\" said he, \"costs a great deal, it is true; but I am paid for\\nit by the additional price.\" I was struck with this notable triumph of\\nindustry and skill in the goodly art of husbandry--that art which I\\nvenerate above every other; and I was all anxiety to receive from him\\nsome instructions which I might, in case I should have the good fortune\\nto get safely back, communicate to my friends on Long-Island, who had\\nnever been able even to double the common size, and who boasted greatly\\nof that: but a hesitating look, and a few inquiries on the part of my\\nsly friend, checked my enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Have you always,\" he asked, \"had the same number of acres in grain and\\ngrass under your new and old system?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty nearly,\" says the other. \"My new breed, however, though fewer,\\nconsume more than their predecessors.\"\\n\\n\"How many head did you formerly sell in a year?\"\\n\\n\"About thirty.\"\\n\\n\"How many do you now sell?\"\\n\\n\"Though for some years I have not sold more than nine or ten, I expect\\nto exceed that number in another year.\"\\n\\n\"Which you expect will yield you more than the thirty did formerly?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; because such meat as mine commands an extraordinary price.\"\\n\\n\"So long,\" replied the Brahmin, \"as this is novelty, you may receive a\\npart of the price which men are ever ready to pay for it; but as soon as\\nothers profit by your example, your meat falls to the ordinary rate, and\\nthen, if I understand you aright, as you will have somewhat less in\\nquantity than you formerly had, your gross receipts will be less, to say\\nnothing of your additional labour and expense.\"\\n\\n\"But who has the skill,\" quickly rejoined the other, \"of which I can\\nboast? and who would take the same trouble, although they had\\nthe skill?\"\\n\\n\"But stop here a moment,\" said our host, \"till I go to see how my last\\nimproved oil-cake is relished by my cattle.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin then turning to me, said,--\"This gentleman may, indeed,\\nimprove his fortune by the business of a grazier; but the same pains and\\nunremitting attention would always be sure of a liberal reward, though\\nthe system on which they were exerted was not among the best. Nothing,\\nmy dear Atterley, is more true than the saying of your wise book--_that\\nall flesh is grass;_ and it always takes the same quantity of one to\\nmake a given quantity of the other, whether that given quantity may be\\nin the form of a single individual, or two or three. But in the former\\ncase, great labour is required to force nature beyond her ordinary\\nlimits, and the same labour must be unceasingly kept up, or she will\\ncertainly relapse to her original dimensions. This system may do, as our\\nhost here tells us it actually does, for the moon, but it is not suited\\nto our earth. If, however, you are ambitious of a name among the\\nspeculative men of your country, this little stone,\" added he, stooping,\\nand picking up a small stone from the ground, \"will answer your purpose\\nquite as well as any improvement in husbandry. It is precisely of the\\nsame species as those which we threw over in our aerial voyages, and\\nwhich, though correctly called moon-stones by the vulgar, (who are\\noftener right than the learned suppose,) some of the western\\nphilosophers declared to have been gravitated in the atmosphere.\"\\n\\n\"And is this really the origin,\" said I, \"of that strange phenomenon,\\nwhich has furnished so much matter of speculation to the sages both of\\nEurope and America?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more true,\" replied he. \"These stones are common to the\\nearth and to the moon; and some of those which have been so carefully\\nanalyzed by your most celebrated chemists, and pronounced different from\\nany known mineral production of the earth, were small fragments of a\\nvery common rock in the mountains of Burma. In our first voyages we had\\ntaken some of them with us as ballast; and those which we first threw\\nover, we afterwards learnt from the public journals, fell in France,\\nsome of the others fell in India, but the greater number in the ocean.\\nThose which have fallen at other times, have been real fossils of the\\nmoon, and either such stones as this I hold in my hand, or such metallic\\nsubstances as are repelled from that body, and attracted towards the\\nearth; and it is the force with which they strike the earth, which first\\nsuggested the idea of a thunder-bolt.\\n\\n\"Our party were greatly amused at the disputations of a learned society\\nin Europe, in which they undertook to give a mathematical demonstration\\nthat they could not be thrown from a volcano of the earth, nor from the\\nmoon, but were suddenly formed in the atmosphere. I should as soon\\nbelieve that a loaf of bread could be made and baked in the atmosphere.\"\\n\\nFinding that our landlord prided himself on his interior management, as\\nwell as on that without doors, we expressed a wish to see some of his\\nhousehold improvements. He readily consented, and conducted us at once\\ninto his kitchen, and showed us inventions and contrivances out of\\nnumber, for saving fuel, and meat, and labour; in short, for saving\\nevery thing but money. The large room into which he carried us, appeared\\nas a vast laboratory, from the infinite variety of pots, pans, skillets,\\nknives, forks, ladles, mortars, sieves, funnels, and other utensils of\\nmetal, glass, pottery, and wood. The steam which he used for cooking,\\nwas carried along a pipe under a succession of kettles and boilers,\\ndescending in regular gradation, by which a great saving of fuel was\\neffected; and, to perfect this part of the apparatus, the pipe could be\\nremoved, to give place to one of the size suited to the occasion.\\n\\nHis seven-guest pipe was now in use. The wood, which was all cut to the\\nsame length, and channelled out to admit the free passage of the air,\\nwas then duly placed in the stove, and set on fire; but the heat not\\npassing very readily through all the sinuosities of the pipe, he ordered\\nhis head cook to screw on his exhauster. The man, in less than ten\\nminutes, unscrewed a plate at the farther end, and fixed on an air-pump,\\nmade for the purpose, on which the door of the stove suddenly slammed\\nto. Our host saw the accident, and hurrying to open the stove, fell over\\na heap of channelled logs, and cut a gash in his forehead. The cook ran\\nto help him up; and after he was on his legs, and his forehead wiped,\\nthe stove was opened, when the fire, which had been deprived of its\\naliment, was entirely extinguished. I thought he was hardly sorry for\\nthe accident, as it afforded him an occasion of showing how ingeniously\\nhe kindled a fire. He had an electric machine brought to him, by means\\nof which he set fire to a few grains of gunpowder; this lighted some\\ntinder, which again ignited spirits, whose blaze reached the lower\\nextremity of his lamp. Taking the precaution of keeping the stove open\\nthis time, the air was again exhausted at the farther end of the pipe,\\nand in a little time the flame was seen to ascend even to the air-pump,\\nand to scorch the parts made of wood; whereupon I saw a glow of triumph\\non his face, which amply compensated him for his wound and vexation.\\nThere was a grand machine for roasting, that carried the fire round the\\nmeat, the juices of which, he said, by a rotary motion, would be thrown\\nto the surface, and either evaporate or be deteriorated. Here was also\\nhis digestor, for making soup of rams\\' horns, which he assured me\\ncontained a good deal of nourishment, and the only difficulty was in\\nextracting it. He next showed us his smoke-retractor, which received the\\nsmoke near the top of the chimney, and brought it down to be burnt over\\nagain, by which he computed that he saved five cords and a half of wood\\nin a year. The fire which dressed his victuals, pumped up, by means of a\\nsteam engine, water for the kitchen turned one or more spits, as well as\\ntwo or three mills for grinding pepper, salt, &c.; and then, by a\\nspindle through the wall, worked a churn in the dairy, and cleaned the\\nknives: the forks, indeed, were still cleaned by hand; but he said he\\ndid not despair of effecting this operation in time, by machinery. I\\nmentioned to him our contrivance of silver forks, to lessen this labour;\\nbut he coldly remarked, that he imagined science was in its infancy\\nwith us.\\n\\nHe informed us that he had been ten years in completing this ingenious\\nmachine; and certainly, when it was in full operation, I never saw\\nexultation and delight so strongly depicted in any human face. The\\nvarious sounds and sights, that met the ear and eye, in rapid\\nsuccession, still farther worked on his feelings, and heightened his\\nraptures. There was such a simmering, and hissing, and bubbling of\\nboiled, and broiled, and fried--such a whirling, and jerking, and\\ncreaking of wheels, and cranks, and pistons--such clouds of steam, and\\nvapours, and even smoke, notwithstanding all of the latter that was\\nburnt,--that I almost thought myself in some great manufactory.\\n\\nAfter having suffered as much as we could well bear, from the heat and\\nconfined air of this laboratory of eatables, and passed the proper\\nnumber of compliments on the skill and ingenuity they displayed, we\\nascended to his hall, to partake of that feast, to prepare which we had\\nseen all the elements and the mechanical powers called into action.\\nThere were a few of his city acquaintances present, besides ourselves:\\nbut whether it was owing to the effect of the steam from the dishes on\\nour stomachs, or that this scientific cookery was not suited to our\\nunpractised palates, I know not, but we all made an indifferent repast,\\nexcept our host, who tasted every dish, and seemed to relish them all.\\n\\nAfter sitting some time at table, conversing on the progress of science,\\nits splendid achievements, and the pleasing prospects which it yet dimly\\nshowed in the future, our hospitable entertainer, perceiving we were\\nfatigued with the labours of the day, invited us to take our next\\n_lallaneae_, or sleep, with him, for which hospitality we felt very\\ngrateful. We were then shown to a room, in which there were marks of the\\nsame fertile invention, in saving labour and promoting convenience; but\\nwe were too sleepy to take much notice of them. Our beds were filled\\nwith air, which is quite as good as feathers, except that when the\\nleather covering gets a hole in it, from ripping, or other accidents, it\\nloses its elasticity with its air--an accident which happened to me this\\nvery night; for a mouse having gnawed the leather where the housemaid\\'s\\ngreasy fingers had left a mark, I sunk gently down, not to soft repose,\\nbut on the hard planks, where I uncomfortably lay until the bell warned\\nus to rise for breakfast.\\n\\nAs soon as I was dressed, I walked out into a large garden, and, as the\\nsun was not yet so high as to make it sultry, was enjoying the balmy\\nsweetness of the air, and the flowering shrubs, which in beauty and\\nfragrance almost exceeded those of India, when I saw a servant run by\\nthe garden wall, enter the stable, and bring out a zebra. On inquiring\\nthe cause, I was made to understand that our noble host was taken\\nsuddenly ill. I immediately returned to the house, and found the\\ndomestics running to and fro, and manifesting the greatest anxiety, as\\nwell as hurry, in their looks. I went into the Brahmin\\'s room, and found\\nhim dressed. He went out, and after some time, informed me that our kind\\nhost had a violent _cholera morbus_, in consequence of the various kinds\\nof food with which he had overloaded his stomach at dinner; that he\\nconsidered himself near his last end, and was endeavouring to arrange\\nhis affairs for the event.\\n\\nI could not help meditating on the melancholy uncertainty of human life,\\nwhen I contrasted the comforts, the pleasures, the pride of conscious\\nusefulness and genius felt by this gentleman a short time since, with\\nthe agony which that trying and bitter hour brings to the stoutest and\\nmost callous heart--when it must quit this state of being for another,\\nof which it knows so little, and over which fear and doubt throw a gloom\\nthat hope cannot entirely dispel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n_Lunarian physicians: their consultation--While they dispute the patient\\nrecovers--The travellers visit the celebrated teacher Lozzi Pozzi._\\n\\n\\nWhile I indulged in these sad meditations, and felt for my host while I\\nfelt no less for myself, I saw the physician approach who had been sent\\nfor. He was a tall, thin man, with a quick step, a lively, piercing eye,\\na sallow complexion, and very courteous manners, and always willing to\\ndisplay the ready flow of words for which he was remarkable. I felt\\ngreat curiosity to witness the skill of this Lunar Aesculapius, and he\\nwas evidently pleased with the interest I manifested. It turned out that\\nhe was well acquainted with the Brahmin; and learning from the latter my\\nwish, he conducted me into the room of our sick host. We found him lying\\non a straw bed, and strangely altered within a few hours. The physician,\\nafter feeling his pulse, (which, as every country has its peculiar\\ncustoms, is done here about the temples and neck, instead of the\\nwrist)--after examining his tongue, his teeth, his water, and feces,\\nproposed bleeding. We all walked to the door, and ventured to oppose the\\ndoctor\\'s prescription, suggesting that the copious evacuations he had\\nalready experienced, might make bleeding useless, if not dangerous.\\n\\n\"How little like a man of sense you speak,\" said the other; \"how readily\\nyou have chimed in with the prejudices of the vulgar! I should have\\nexpected better things from you: but the sway of empiricism is destined\\nyet to have a long struggle before it receives its final overthrow. I\\nhave attacked it with success in many quarters; but when it has been\\nprostrated in one place, it soon rises up in another. Have you, my good\\nfriend, seen my last essay on morbid action?\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin replied, that he had not yet had an opportunity of meeting\\nwith it.\\n\\n\"I am sorry you have not,\" said the other. \"I have there completely\\ndemonstrated that disease is an unit, and that it is the extreme of\\nfolly to divide diseases into classes, which tend but to produce\\nconfusion of ideas, and an unscientific practice. Sir,\" continued he, in\\na more animated tone, \"there is a beautiful simplicity in this theory,\\nwhich gives us assurance of its conformity to nature and truth. It needs\\nbut to be seen to be understood--but to be understood, to be approved,\\nand carried into successful operation.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin asked him if this unit did not present different symptoms on\\ndifferent occasions.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied: \"from too much or too little action, in this\\nset of vessels or that, it is differently modified, and must be treated\\naccordingly.\"\\n\\n\"This unit, then,\" said my friend, \"assumes different forms, and\\nrequires various remedies? Is there not, then, a convenience in\\nseparating these modifications (or _forms_, if you prefer it) from one\\nanother, by different names?\"\\n\\n\"Stop, my friend; you do not apprehend the matter. I will explain.\" At\\nthis moment two other gentlemen, of a grave aspect and demeanour,\\nentered the room. They also were physicians of great reputation in the\\ncity. They appeared to be formal and reserved towards one another, but\\nthey each manifested still more shyness and coldness towards the learned\\nShuro. They entered the sick chamber, and having informed themselves of\\nthe state of the patient, all three withdrew to a consultation.\\n\\nThey had not been long together, before their voices grew, from a\\nwhisper, so loud, that we could distinctly hear all they said. \"Sir,\"\\nsays Dr. Shakrack, \"the patient is in a state of direct debility: we\\nmust stimulate, if we would restore a healthy action. Pour in the\\n_stimulantia_ and _irritentia_, and my life for it, the patient\\nis saved.\"\\n\\n\"Will you listen to me for one moment?\" says Dr. Dridrano, the youngest\\nof the three gentlemen. \"It may be presumption for one of my humble\\npretensions to set myself in opposition to persons of your age,\\nexperience, and celebrity; but I am bound, by the sacred duties of the\\nhigh functions I have undertaken to perform, to use my poor abilities in\\nsuch a way as I can, to advance the noble science of medicine, and, in\\nso doing, to give strength to the weak, courage to the disheartened, and\\ncomfort to the afflicted. Gentlemen, I say, I hope if my simple views\\nshould be found widely different from yours, you will not impute it to a\\npresumption which is as foreign to my nature as it would be unsuited to\\nyour merits. I consider the human body a mere machine, whose parts are\\ncomplicated, whose functions are various, and whose operations are\\nliable to be impeded and frustrated by a variety of obstacles. There is,\\nyou know, one set of tubes, or vessels, for the blood; another for the\\nlymph; another for the sweat; and so on. Now, although each of these\\nfluids has its several channels, yet, if by any accident any one of them\\nis obstructed, and there is so great an accumulation of the obstructed\\nfluid that it cannot find vent by its natural channel, or duct, then you\\nmust carry off the redundancy by some other; for you well know, that\\nthat which can be carried off by one, can be carried off by all.\\nGentlemen, I beg you not to turn away; hear me for a moment. Then, if\\nthe current of the blood be obstructed, I make large draughts of urine,\\nor sweat or saliva, or of the liquor amnii; and I find it matters little\\nwhich of these evacuants I resort to. This system, to which, with\\ndeference to your longer experience, I have had the honour of giving\\nsome celebrity in Morosofia, explains how it is that such various\\nremedies for the same disease have been in vogue at different times.\\nThey have all had in town able advocates. I could adduce undeniable\\ntestimonials of their efficacy, because, in fact, they are all\\nefficacious; and it seems to me a mere matter of earthshine, whether we\\nresort to one or the other mode of restoring the equilibrium of the\\nhuman machine; all that we have to do, being to know when and to what\\nextent it is proper to use either. Determine, then, gentlemen,--you, for\\nwhose maturer judgment and years I feel profound respect,--whether we\\nshall blister, or sweat, or bleed, or salivate.\"\\n\\nDr. Shuro, who had manifested his impatience at this long harangue, by\\nfrequent interruptions, and which Dridrano\\'s show of deference could\\nscarcely keep down, hastily replied: \"You have manifestly taken the hint\\nof your theory from me; and because I have advanced the doctrine that\\ndisease is an unit, you come forward now, and insist that remedy is an\\nunit too.\"\\n\\n\"You do me great honour, learned sir,\" said Dridrano. \"Surely it would\\nbe very unbecoming, in one of my age and standing, to set up a theory in\\nopposition to yours, but it would be yet more discreditable to be a\\nplagiarist; and, with all due respect for your superior wisdom, it does\\nseem to my feeble intellect, that no two theories can be more different.\\nYou use several remedies for one disease: I admit several diseases, and\\nuse one remedy.\"\\n\\n\"And does not darkness remind us of light,\" replied Shuro, \"by the\\ncontrast? heat of cold--north of south?\"\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" then said Shakrack, who had been walking to and fro, during\\nthe preceding controversy, \"as you seem to agree so ill with each other,\\nI trust you will unite in adopting my course. Let us begin with this\\ncordial; we will then vary the stimulus, if necessary, by means of the\\nelixir, and you will see the salutary effects immediately. A loss of\\nblood would still farther increase the debility of the patient; and I\\nappeal to your candour, Dr. Shuro, whether you ever practised\\nvenesection in such a case?\"\\n\\n\"In such a case? ay, in what _you_ would call much worse. I was not long\\nsince called in to a man in a dropsy. I opened a vein. He seemed from\\nthat moment to feel relief; and he so far recovered, that after a short\\ntime I bled him again. I returned the next day, and had I arrived half\\nan hour sooner, I should have bled him a third time, and in all human\\nprobability have saved his life.\"\\n\\n\"If you had stimulated him, you might have had an opportunity of making\\nyour favourite experiment a little oftener,\" said Shakrack.\\n\\n\"You are facetious, sir; I imagine you have been using your own panacea\\nsomewhat too freely to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Not so,\" said his opponent, angrily; \"but if you are not more guarded\\nin your expressions, I shall make use of yours, in a way you\\nwon\\'t like.\"\\n\\nUpon which they proceeded to blows, Dridrano all the while bellowing, \"I\\nbeg, my worthy seniors, for the honour of science, that you\\nwill forbear!\"\\n\\nThe noise of the dispute had waked the patient, who, learning the cause\\nof the disturbance, calmly begged they would give themselves no concern\\nabout him, but let him die in peace. The domestics, who had been for\\nsome time listening to the dispute, on hearing the scuffle, ran in and\\nparted the angry combatants, who, like an abscess just lanced, were\\ngiving vent to all the malignant humours that had been so long silently\\ngathering.\\n\\nIn the mean while, the smooth and considerate Dr. Dridrano stept into\\nthe sick room, with the view of offering an apology for the unmannerly\\nconduct of his brethren, and of tendering his single services, as the\\nother sages of the healing art could not agree in the course to be\\npursued; when he found that the patient, profiting by the simple\\nremedies of the Brahmin, and an hour\\'s rest, had been so much refreshed,\\nthat he considered himself out of danger, and that he had no need of\\nmedical assistance; or, at any rate, he was unwilling to follow the\\nprescriptions of one physician, which another, if not two others,\\nunhesitatingly condemned. Each one then received his fee, and hurried\\nhome, to publish his own statement of the case in a pamphlet.\\n\\nThe Brahmin, who had never left the sick man\\'s couch during his sleep,\\nnow that he was out of danger, was greatly diverted at the dispute. But\\nhe good-naturedly added, that, notwithstanding the ridiculous figure\\nthey had that day made, they were all men of genius and ability, but had\\ndone their parts injustice by their vanity, and the ambition of\\noriginating a new theory. \"With all the extravagance,\" said he, \"to\\nwhich they push their several systems, they are not unsuccessful in\\npractice, for habitual caution, and an instinctive regard for human\\nlife, which they never can extinguish, checks them in carrying their\\nhypotheses into execution: and if I might venture to give an opinion on\\na subject of which I know so little, and there is so much to be known, I\\nwould say, that the most common error of theorists is to consider man as\\na machine, rather than an animal, and subject to one set of the laws of\\nmatter, rather than as subject to them all.\\n\\n\"Thus,\" he continued, \"we have been regarded by one class of theorists\\nas an hydraulic engine, composed of various tubes fitted with their\\nseveral fluids, the laws and functions of which have been deduced from\\ncalculations of velocities, altitudes, diameters, friction, &c. Another\\nclass considered man as a mere chemical engine, and his stomach as an\\nalembic. The doctrine of affinities, attractions, and repulsions, now\\nhad full play. Then came the notion of sympathies and antipathies, by\\nwhich name unknown and unknowable causes were sought to be explained,\\nand ignorance was cunningly veiled in mystery. But the science will\\nnever be in the right tract of improvement, until we consider,\\nconjointly, the mechanical operations of the fluids, the chemical agency\\nof the substances taken into the stomach, and the animal functions of\\ndigestion, secretion, and absorption, as evinced by actual observation.\"\\nI told him that I believed that was now the course which was actually\\npursued in the best medical schools, both of Europe and America.\\n\\nOur worthy host, though very feeble, had so far recovered as to dress\\nhimself, and receive the congratulations of his household, who had all\\nmanifested a concern for his situation, that was at once creditable to\\nhim and themselves. Expressing our gratitude for his kind attentions,\\nand promising to renew our visit if we could, we bade him adieu.\\n\\nWe took a different road home from the way we had come, and had not\\nwalked far, before we met a number of small boys, each having a bag on\\nhis back, as large as he could stagger under. Surprised at seeing\\nchildren of their tender years, thus prematurely put to severe labour, I\\nwas about to rail at the absurd custom of this strange country, when my\\nfriend checked me for my hasty judgment, and told me that these boys\\nwere on their way to school, after their usual monthly holiday. We\\nattended them to their schoolhouse, which stood in sight, on the side of\\na steep chalky hill. The Brahmin told me that the teacher\\'s name was\\nLozzi Pozzi, and that he had acquired great celebrity by his system of\\ninstruction. When the boys opened their bags, I found that instead of\\nbooks and provisions, as I had expected, they were filled with sticks,\\nwhich they told us constituted the arithmetical lessons they were\\nrequired to practise at home. These sticks were of different lengths and\\ndimensions, according to the number marked on them; so that by looking\\nat the inscription, you could tell the size, or by seeing or feeling the\\nsize, you could tell the number.\\n\\nThe master now made his appearance, and learning our errand, was very\\ncommunicative. He descanted on the advantages of this manual, and ocular\\nmode of teaching the science of numbers, and gave us practical\\nillustrations of its efficacy, by examining his pupils in our presence.\\nHe told the first boy he called up, and who did not seem to be more than\\nseven or eight years of age, to add 5, 3, and 7 together, and tell him\\nthe result. The little fellow set about hunting, with great alacrity,\\nover his bag, until he found a piece divided like three fingers, then a\\npiece with five divisions, and lastly, one with seven, and putting them\\nside by side, he found the piece of a correspondent length, and thus, in\\nless than eight minutes and a half, answered, \"fifteen.\" The ingenious\\nmaster then exercised another boy in subtraction, and a third in\\nmultiplication: but the latter was thrown into great confusion, for one\\nof the pieces having lost a division, it led him to a wrong result.\\n\\nThe teacher informed us that he taught geometry in the same way, and had\\neven extended it to grammar, logic, rhetoric, and the art of\\ncomposition. The rules of syntax were discovered by pieces of wood,\\ninterlocking with each other in squares, dovetails, &c., after the\\nmanner of geographical cards; and as they chanced to fit together, so\\nwas the concordance between the several parts of speech ascertained. The\\nmachine for composition occupied a large space; different sets of\\nsynonymes were arranged in compartments of various sizes. When the\\nsubject was familiar, a short piece was used; when it was stately or\\nheroic, then the longest slips that could be found were resorted to.\\nThose that were rounded at the ends were mellifluous; the jagged ones\\nwere harsh; the thick pieces expressed force and vigour. Where the\\ncurves corresponded at one end, they served for alliteration; and when\\nat the other, they answered for rhyme. By way of proving its progress,\\nhe showed us a composition by a man who was deaf and dumb, in praise of\\nMorosofia, who, merely by the use of his eyes and hands, had made an\\ningenious and high-sounding piece of eloquence, though I confess that\\nthe sense was somewhat obscure. We went away filled with admiration for\\nthe great Lozzi Pozzi\\'s inventions.\\n\\nHaving understood that there was an academy in the neighbourhood, in\\nwhich youths of maturer years were instructed in the fine arts, we were\\ninduced to visit it; but there being a vacation at that time, we could\\nsee neither the professors nor students, and consequently could gain\\nlittle information of the course of discipline and instruction pursued\\nthere. We were, however, conducted to a small _menagerie_ attached to\\nthe institution, by its keeper, where the habits and accomplishments of\\nthe animals bore strong testimony in favour of the diligence and skill\\nof their teachers.\\n\\nWe there saw two game-cocks, which, so far from fighting, (though they\\nhad been selected from the most approved breed,) billed and cooed like\\nturtle-doves. There was a large zebra, apparently ill-tempered, which\\nshowed his anger by running at and butting every animal that came in his\\nway. Two half-grown llamas, which are naturally as quiet and timid as\\nsheep, bit each other very furiously, until they foamed at the mouth.\\nAnd, lastly, a large mastiff made his appearance, walking in a slow,\\nmeasured gait, with a sleek tortoise-shell cat on his back; and she, in\\nturn, was surmounted by a mouse, which formed the apex of this\\nsingular pyramid.\\n\\nThe keeper, remarking our unaffected surprise at the exhibition, asked\\nus if we could now doubt the unlimited force of education, after such a\\ndisplay of the triumph of art over nature. While he was speaking, the\\nmastiff, being jostled by the two llamas still awkwardly worrying each\\nother, turned round so suddenly, that the mouse was dislodged from his\\nlofty position, and thrown to the ground; on seeing which, the cat\\nimmediately sprang upon it, with a loud purring noise, which being heard\\nby the dog, he, with a fierce growl, suddenly seized the cat. The\\nllamas, alarmed at this terrific sound, instinctively ran off, and\\nhaving, in their flight, approached the heels of the zebra, he gave a\\nkick, which killed one of them on the spot.\\n\\nThe keeper, who was deeply mortified at seeing the fabric he had raised\\nwith such indefatigable labour, overturned in a moment, protested that\\nnothing of the sort had ever happened before. To which we replied, by\\nway of consolation, that perhaps the same thing might never happen\\nagain; and that, while his art had achieved a conquest over nature, this\\nwas only a slight rebellion of nature against art. We then thanked him\\nfor his politeness, and took our leave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n_Election of the Numnoonce, or town-constable--Violence\\nof parties--Singular institution of the Syringe Boys--The\\nprize-fighters--Domestic manufactures._\\n\\n\\nWhen we got back to the city, we found an unusual stir and bustle among\\nthe citizens, and on inquiring the cause, we understood they were about\\nto elect the town-constable. After taking some refreshment at our\\nlodgings, where we were very kindly received, we again went out, and\\nwere hurried along with the crowd, to a large building near the centre\\nof the city. The multitude were shouting and hallooing with great\\nvehemence. The Brahmin remarking an elderly man, who seemed very quiet\\nin the midst of all this ferment, he thought him a proper person to\\naddress for information.\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" says he, \"from the violence of these partisans, they are on\\ndifferent sides in religion or politics?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" said the other; \"those differences are forgotten at the\\npresent, and the ground of the dispute is, that one of the candidates is\\ntall, and the other is short--one has a large foretop, and the other is\\nbald. Oh, I forgot; one has been a schoolmaster, and the other\\na butcher.\"\\n\\nCuriosity now prompted me to enter into the thickest of the throng; and\\nI had never seen such fury in the maddest contests between old George\\nClinton and Mr. Jay, or De Witt Clinton and Governor Tompkins, in my\\nnative State. They each reproached their adversaries in the coarsest\\nlanguage, and attributed to them the vilest principles and motives. Our\\nguide farther told us that the same persons, with two others, had been\\ncandidates last year, when the schoolmaster prevailed; and, as the\\nsupporters of the other two unsuccessful candidates had to choose now\\nbetween the remaining two, each party was perpetually reproaching the\\nother with inconsistency. A dialogue between two individuals of opposite\\nsides, which we happened to hear, will serve as a specimen of the rest.\\n\\n\"Are you not a pretty fellow to vote for Bald-head, whom you have so\\noften called rogue and blockhead?\"\\n\\n\"It becomes you to talk of consistency, indeed! Pray, sir, how does it\\nhappen that you are now against him, when you were so lately sworn\\nfriends, and used to eat out of the same dish?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but I was the butcher\\'s friend too. I never abused him. You\\'ll\\nnever catch me supporting a man I have once abused.\"\\n\\n\"But I catch you abusing the man you once supported, which is rather\\nworse. The difference between us is this:--you professed to be friendly\\nto both; I professed to be hostile to both: you stuck to one of your\\nfriends, and cast the other off; and I acted the same towards my\\nenemies.\" A crowd then rushed by, crying \"Huzza for the Butcher\\'s\\nknives! Damn pen and ink--damn the books, and all that read in them!\\nButchers\\' knives and beef for ever!\"\\n\\nWe asked our guide what these men were to gain by the issue of the\\ncontest.\\n\\n\"Nineteenths of them nothing. But a few hope to be made deputies, if\\ntheir candidates succeed, and they therefore egg on the rest.\"\\n\\nWe drew near to the scaffold where the candidates stood, and our ears\\nwere deafened with the mingled shouts and exclamations of praise and\\nreproach. \"You cheated the corporation!\" says one. \"You killed two black\\nsheep!\" says another. \"You can\\'t read a warrant!\" \"You let Dondon cheat\\nyou!\" \"You tried to cheat Nincan!\" \"You want to build a watch-house!\"\\n\"You have an old ewe at home now, that you did not come honestly by!\"\\n\"You denied your own hand!\"--with other ribaldry still more gross and\\nindecent. But the most singular part of the scene was a number of little\\nboys, dressed in black and white, who all wore badges of the parties to\\nwhich they belonged, and were provided with a syringe, and two canteens,\\none filled with rose-water, and the other with a black liquid, of a very\\noffensive smell, the first of which they squirted at their favourite\\ncandidates and voters, and the last on those of the opposite party. They\\nwere drawn up in a line, and seemed to be under regular discipline; for,\\nwhenever the captain of the band gave the word, \"Vilti Mindoc!\" they\\ndischarged the dirty liquid from their syringes; and when he said \"Vilti\\nGoulgoul!\" they filled the air with perfume, that was so overpowering as\\nsometimes to produce sickness. The little fellows would, between whiles,\\nas if to keep their hands in, use the black squirts against one another;\\nbut they often gave them a dash of the rose-water at the same time.\\n\\nI wondered to see men submit to such indignity; but was told that the\\ncustom had the sanction of time; that these boys were brought up in the\\nchurch, and were regularly trained to this business. \"Besides,\" added my\\ninformer, \"the custom is not without its use; for it points out the\\ncandidates at once to a stranger, and especially him who is successful,\\nthose being always the most blackened who are the most popular.\" But it\\nwas amusing to see the ludicrous figure that the candidates and some of\\nthe voters made. If you came near them on one side, they were like roses\\ndripping with the morning dew; but on the other, they were as black as\\nchimney sweeps, and more offensive than street scavengers. As these\\nSyringe Boys, or Goulmins, are thus protected by custom, the persons\\nassailed affected to despise them; but I could ever and anon see some of\\nthe most active partisans clapping them on the back, and saying, \"Well\\ndone, my little fellows! give it to them again! You shall have a\\nginger-cake--and you shall have a new cap,\" &c. Surely, thought I, our\\ncustom of praising and abusing our public men in the newspapers, is far\\nmore rational than this. After the novelty of the scene was over, I\\nbecame wearied and disgusted with their coarseness, violence, and want\\nof decency, and we left them without waiting to see the result of\\nthe contest.\\n\\nIn returning to our lodgings, the Brahmin took me along a quarter of the\\ntown in which I had never before been. In a little while we came to a\\nlofty building, before the gate of which a great crowd were assembled.\\n\"This,\" said my companion, \"is one of the courts of justice.\" Anxious to\\nsee their modes of proceeding in court, I pushed through the crowd,\\nfollowed by the Brahmin, and on entering the building, found myself in a\\nspacious amphitheatre, in the middle of which I beheld, with surprise,\\nseveral men engaged, hand to hand, in single combat. On asking an\\nexplanation of my friend, he informed me that these contests were\\nfavourite modes of settling private disputes in Morosofia: that the\\nprize-fighters I saw, hired themselves to any one who conceived himself\\ninjured in person, character, or property. \"It seems a strange mode of\\nsettling legal disputes,\" I remarked, \"which determines a question in\\nfavour of a party, according to the strength and wind of his champion.\"\\n\\n\"Nor is that all,\" said the Brahmin, \"as the judges assign the victory\\naccording to certain rules and precedents, the reasons of which are\\nknown only to themselves, if known at all, and which are often\\nsufficiently whimsical--as sometimes a small scratch in the head avails\\nmore than a disabling blow in the body. The blows too, must be given in\\nthe right time, as well as in the right place, or they pass for nothing.\\nIn short, of all those spectators who are present to witness the powers\\nand address of the prize-fighters, not one in a hundred can tell who has\\ngained the victory, until the judges have proclaimed it.\"\\n\\n\"I presume,\" said I, \"that the champions who thus expose their persons\\nand lives in the cause of another, are Glonglims?\"\\n\\n\"There,\" said he, \"you are altogether mistaken. In the first place, the\\nprize-fighters seldom sustain serious injury. Their weapons do not\\nendanger life; and as each one knows that his adversary is merely\\nfollowing his vocation, they often fight without animosity. After the\\ncontest is over, you may commonly see the combatants walking and talking\\nvery sociably together: but as this circumstance makes them a little\\nsuspected by the public, they affect the greater rage when in conflict,\\nand occasionally quarrel and fight in downright earnest. No,\" he\\ncontinued, \"I am told it is a very rare thing to see one of these\\nprize-fighters who is a Glonglim; but most of their employers belong to\\nthis unhappy race.\"\\n\\nOn looking more attentively, I perceived many of these beings among the\\nspectators, showing, by their gestures, the greatest anxiety for the\\nissue of the contest. They each carried a scrip, or bag, the contents of\\nwhich they ever and anon gave to their respective champions, whose wind,\\nit is remarked, is very apt to fail, unless thus assisted.\\n\\nHaving learnt some farther particulars respecting this singular mode of\\nlitigation, which would be uninteresting to the general reader, I took\\nmy leave, not without secretly congratulating myself on the more\\nrational modes in which justice is administered on earth.\\n\\nWhen we had nearly reached our lodgings, we heard a violent altercation\\nin the house, and on entering, we found our landlord and his wife\\nengaged in a dispute respecting their domestic economy, and they both\\nmade earnest appeals to my companion for the correctness of their\\nrespective opinions. The old man was in favour of their children making\\ntheir own shoes and clothes; and his wife insisted that it would be\\nbetter for them to stick to their garden and dairy, with the proceeds of\\nwhich they could purchase what they wanted. She asserted that they could\\nreadily sell all the fruits and vegetables they could raise; and that\\nwhilst they would acquire greater skill by an undivided attention to one\\nthing, they who followed the business of tailors, shoemakers, and\\nseamstresses, would, in like manner, become more skilful in their\\nemployments, and consequently be able to work at a cheaper rate. She\\nfarther added, that spinning and sewing were unhealthy occupations; they\\nwould give the girls the habit of stooping, which would spoil their\\nshapes; and that their thoughts would be more likely to be running on\\nidle and dangerous fancies, when sitting at their needles, than when\\nengaged in more active occupations.\\n\\nThis dame was a very fluent, ready-witted woman, and she spoke with the\\nconfidence that consciousness of the powers of disputation commonly\\ninspires. She went on enlarging on the mischiefs of the practice she\\ncondemned, and, by insensible gradations, so magnified them, that at\\nlast she clearly made out that there was no surer way of rendering their\\ndaughters sickly, deformed, vicious, and unchaste, than to set them\\nabout making their own clothes.\\n\\nAfter she had ceased, (which she did under a persuasion that she had\\nanticipated and refuted every argument that could be urged in opposition\\nto her doctrine,) the husband, with an emotion of anger that he could\\nnot conceal, began to defend his opinion. He said, as to the greater\\neconomy of his plan, there could be no doubt; for although they might,\\nat particular times, make more by gardening than they could save by\\nspinning or sewing, yet there were other times when they could not till\\nthe ground, and when, of course, if they did not sew or spin, they would\\nbe idle; but if they did work, the proceeds would be clear gain. He said\\nhe did not wish his daughters to be constantly employed in making\\nclothes, nor was it necessary that they should be. A variety of other\\noccupations, equally indispensable, claimed their attention, and would\\nleave but a comparatively small portion of time for needlework: that in\\nthus providing themselves with employment at home, they at least saved\\nthe time of going backwards and forwards, and were spared some trips to\\nmarket, for the sale of vegetables to pay, as would then be necessary,\\nfor the work done by others. Besides, the tailor who was most convenient\\nto them, and who, it was admitted, was a very good one, was insolent and\\ncapricious; would sometimes extort extravagant prices, or turn them into\\nridicule; and occasionally went so far as to set his water-dogs upon\\nthem, of which he kept a great number. He declared, that for his part he\\nwould incur a little more expense, rather than he would be so imposed\\nupon, and subjected to so much indignity and vexation.\\n\\nHe denied that sewing would affect his daughters\\' health, unless,\\nperhaps, they followed it exclusively as an occupation; but, as they\\nwould have it in their power to consult their inclinations and\\nconvenience in this matter, they might take it up when the occasion\\nrequired, and lay it down whenever they found it irksome or fatiguing:\\nthat as they themselves were inclined to follow this course, it was a\\nplain proof that the occupation was not unhealthy. He maintained that\\nthey would stoop just as much in gardening, and washing and nursing\\ntheir children, as in sewing; and that we were not such frail or\\nunpliant machines as to be seriously injured, unless we persisted in one\\nset of straight, formal notions, but that we were adapted to variety,\\nand were benefited by it. That as to the practice being favourable to\\nwantonness and vice, while he admitted that idleness was productive of\\nthese effects, he could not see how one occupation encouraged them more\\nthan another. That the tailor, for example, whom he had been speaking\\nof, though purse-proud, overbearing, and rapacious, was not more immoral\\nor depraved than his neighbours, and had probably less of the libertine\\nthan most of them. He admitted that evil thoughts would enter the mind\\nin any situation, and could not reasonably be expected to be kept out of\\nhis daughters\\' heads (being, as he said, but women): yet he conceived\\nsuch a result as far less probable, if they were suffered to ramble\\nabout in the streets, and to chaffer with their customers, than if they\\nwere kept to sedate and diligent employment at home.\\n\\nHaving, with great warmth and earnestness, used these arguments, he\\nconcluded, by plainly hinting to his wife that she had always been the\\napologist of the tailor, in all their disputes; and that she could not\\nbe so obstinately blind to the irrefragable reasoning he had urged, if\\nshe were not influenced by her old hankering after this fellow, and did\\nnot consult his interests in preference to those of her own family. Upon\\nthis remark the old woman took fire, and, in spite of our presence, they\\nboth had recourse to direct and the coarsest abuse.\\n\\nThe Brahmin did not, as I expected, join me in laughing at the scene we\\nhad just witnessed; but, after some musing, observed: \"There is much\\ntruth in what each of these parties say. I blame them only for the\\ncourse they take towards each other. Their dispute is, in fact, of a\\nmost frivolous and unmeaning character; for, if the father was to carry\\nhis point, the girls would occasionally sell the productions of their\\ngarden, and pay for making their clothes, or even buy them ready made.\\nWere the mother, on the other hand, to prevail, they would still\\noccasionally use their needles, and exercise their taste and skill in\\nsewing, spinning, knitting, and the like. Nay,\" added he, \"if you had\\nnot been so much engrossed with this angry and indecorous altercation,\\nyou might have seen two of them at their needles, in an adjoining\\napartment, while one was busy at work in the garden, and another up to\\nthe elbows in the soap-suds--all so closely engaged in their several\\npursuits, that they hardly seemed to know they were the subject of\\ndiscussion.\"\\n\\nI told the Brahmin that a dispute, not unlike this, had taken place in\\nmy own country, a few years since; some of our politicians contending\\nthat agricultural labour was most conducive to the national wealth,\\nwhilst others maintained that manufacturing industry was equally\\nadvantageous, wherever it was voluntarily pursued;--but that the\\ncontroversy had lately assumed a different character--the question now\\nbeing, not whether manufactures are as beneficial as agriculture, but\\nwhether they deserve extraordinary encouragement, by taxing those who do\\nnot give them a preference.\\n\\n\"That is,\" said the Brahmin, \"as if our landlady, by way of inducing her\\ndaughters to give up gardening for spinning, were to tell them, if they\\ndid not find their new occupation as profitable as the old, she would\\nmore than make up the difference out of her own pocket, which, though it\\nmight suit the daughters very well, would be a losing business to\\nthe family.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n_Description of the Happy Valley--The laws, customs, and manners of the\\nOkalbians--Theory of population--Rent--System of government._\\n\\n\\nThe Brahmin, who was desirous of showing me what was most remarkable in\\nthis country, during the short time we intended to stay, thought this a\\nfavourable time to visit Okalbia, or the Happy Valley. The Okalbians are\\na tribe or nation, who live separated from the rest of the Lunar world,\\nand whose wise government, prudence, industry, and integrity, are very\\nhighly extolled by all, though, by what I can learn, they have few\\nimitators. They dwell about three hundred miles north of the city of\\nAlamatua, in a fertile valley, which they obtained by purchase about two\\nhundred years since, and which is about equal to twenty miles square,\\nthat is, to four hundred square miles. A carriage and four well-broke\\ndogs, was procured for us, and we soon reached the foot of the mountain\\nthat encloses the fortunate valley, in about fifty-two hours. We then\\nascended, for about three miles, with far fatigue than I formerly\\nexperienced in climbing the Catskill mountains of my native State, and\\nfound ourselves on the summit of an extensive ridge, which formed the\\nmargin of a vast elliptical basin, the bottom of which presented a most\\nbeautiful landscape. The whole surface was like a garden, interspersed\\nwith patches of wood, clumps of trees, and houses standing singly or in\\ngroupes. A lake, about a mile across, received several small streams,\\nand on its edge was a town, containing about a thousand houses. After\\nenjoying the beauties of the scene for some minutes, we descended by a\\nrough winding road, and entered this Lunar Paradise, in about four\\nhours. Along the sides of the highway we travelled, were planted rows of\\ntrees, not unlike our sycamores, which afforded a refreshing shade to\\nthe traveller; and commonly a rivulet ran bubbling along one side or the\\nother of the road.\\n\\nAfter journeying about eight miles, we entered a neat, well built town,\\nwhich contained, as we were informed, about fifteen thousand\\ninhabitants. The Brahmin informed me, that in a time of religious\\nfervour, about two centuries ago, a charter was granted to the founder\\nof a new sect, the Volbins, who had chanced to make converts of some of\\nthe leading men in Morosofia, authorising him and his followers to\\npurchase this valley of the hunting tribe to whom it belonged, and to\\ngovern themselves by their own laws. They found no difficulty in making\\nthe purchase. It was then used as a mere hunting ground, no one liking\\nto settle in a place that seemed shut out from the rest of the world. At\\nfirst, the new settlers divided the land equally among all the\\ninhabitants, one of their tenets being, that as there was no difference\\nof persons in the next world, there should be no difference in sharing\\nthe good things of this. They tried at first to preserve this equality;\\nbut finding it impracticable, they abandoned it. It is said that after\\nabout thirty years, by reason of a difference in their industry and\\nfrugality, and of some families spending less than they made, and some\\nmore, the number of land owners was reduced to four hundred, and that\\nfifty of these held one half of the whole; since which time the number\\nof landed proprietors has declined with the population, though not in\\nthe same proportion. As the soil is remarkably fertile, the climate\\nhealthy, and the people temperate and industrious, they multiplied very\\nrapidly until they reached their present numbers, which have been long\\nstationary, and amount to 150,000, that is, about four hundred to a\\nsquare mile; of these, more than one half live in towns and villages,\\ncontaining from one hundred to a thousand houses.\\n\\nThey have little or no commerce with any other people, the valley\\nproducing every vegetable production, and the mountains every mineral,\\nwhich they require; and in fact, they have no foreign intercourse\\nwhatever, except when they visit, or are visited from curiosity. Though\\nthey have been occasionally bullied and threatened by lawless and\\noverbearing neighbours; yet, as they can be approached by only a single\\ngorge in the mountain, which is always well garrisoned, (and they\\npresent no sufficient object to ambition, to compensate for the scandal\\nof invading so inoffensive and virtuous a people,) they have never yet\\nbeen engaged in war.\\n\\nI felt very anxious to know how it was that their numbers did not\\nincrease, as they were exempt from all pestilential diseases, and live\\nin such abundance, that a beggar by trade has never been known among\\nthem, and are remarkable for their moral habits.\\n\\n\"Let us inquire at the fountain-head,\" said the Brahmin; and we went to\\nsee the chief magistrate, who received us in a style of unaffected\\nfrankness, which in a moment put us at our ease. After we had explained\\nto him who we were, and answered such inquiries as he chose to make:\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said I, through the Brahmin, who acted as interpreter, \"I have\\nheard much of your country, and I find, on seeing it, that it exceeds\\nreport, in the order, comfort, contentment, and abundance of the people.\\nBut I am puzzled to find out how it is that your numbers do not\\nincrease. I presume you marry late in life?\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" said he; \"every young man marries as soon as he\\nreceives his education, and is capable of managing the concerns of a\\nfamily. Some are thus qualified sooner, and some later.\"\\n\\n\"Some occasionally migrate, then?\"\\n\\n\"Never. A number of our young men, indeed, visit foreign countries, but\\nnot one in a hundred settles abroad.\"\\n\\n\"How, then, do your associates continue stationary?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more easy. No man has a larger family than his land or\\nlabour can support, in comfort; and as long as that is the case with\\nevery individual, it must continue to be the case with the whole\\ncommunity. We leave the matter to individual discretion. The prudential\\ncaution which is thus indicated, has been taught us by our own\\nexperience. We had gone on increasing, under the encouraging influence\\nof a mild system of laws, genial climate, and fruitful soil, until,\\nabout a century ago, we found that our numbers were greater than our\\ncountry, abundant as it is, could comfortably support; and our seasons\\nbeing unfavourable for two successive years, many of our citizens were\\nobliged to banish themselves from Okalbia; and their education not\\nfitting them for a different state of society, they suffered severely,\\nboth in their comforts and morals. It is now a primary moral duty,\\nenforced by all our juvenile instructors with every citizen, to adapt\\nhis family to his means; and thus a regard which each individual has for\\nhis offspring, is the salvation of the State.\"\\n\\n\"And can these prudential restraints be generally practised? What a\\nvirtuous people! Love for one another brings the two sexes\\ntogether--love for their offspring makes them separate!\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said the magistrate, smiling, \"you are under an error. No\\nseparation takes place, and none is necessary.\"\\n\\n\"How, then, am I to believe.....?\"\\n\\n\"You are to believe nothing,\" said he, with calm dignity, \"which is\\nincompatible with virtue and propriety. I see that the most important of\\nall sciences--that one on which the well-being and improvement of\\nsociety mainly depends,--is in its infancy with you. But whenever you\\nbecome as populous as we are, and unite the knowledge of real happiness\\nwith the practice of virtue, you will understand it. It is one of our\\nmaxims, that heaven gives wisdom to man in such portions as his\\nsituation requires it; and no doubt it is the same with the people of\\nyour earth.\"\\n\\nI did not, after this, push my inquiries farther; but remarked, aside to\\nthe Brahmin,--\"I would give a good deal to know this secret, provided it\\nwould suit our planet.\"\\n\\n\"It is already known there,\" replied he, \"and has been long practised by\\nmany in the east: but in the present state of society with you, it might\\ndo more harm than good to be made public, by removing one of the checks\\nof licentiousness, where women are so unrestrained as they are\\nwith you.\"\\n\\nChanging now the subject, I ventured to inquire how they employed their\\nleisure hours, and whether many did not experience here a wearisome\\nsameness, and a feeling of confinement and restraint.\\n\\n\"It is true,\" said the magistrate, \"men require variety; but I would not\\nhave you suppose he cannot find it here. He may cultivate his lands,\\nimprove his mind, educate his children; these are his serious\\noccupations, affording every day some employment that is, at once, new\\nand interesting: and, by way of relaxation, he has music, painting, and\\nsculpture; sailing, riding, conversation, storytelling, and reading the\\nnews of what is passing, both in the valley and out of it.\"\\n\\nI asked if they had newspapers. He answered in the affirmative; and\\nadded, that they contained minute details of the births, deaths,\\nmarriages, accidents, state of the weather and crops, arbitrations,\\npublic festivals, inventions, original poetry, and prose compositions.\\nIn addition to which, they had about fifty of their most promising young\\nmen travelling abroad, who made observations on all that was remarkable\\nin the countries they passed through, which they regularly transmitted\\nonce a month to Okalbia. I inquired if they travelled at the public\\nexpense or their own?\\n\\n\"They always pursue some profession or trade, by the profits of which\\nthey support themselves. We have nothing but intellect and ingenuity to\\nexport; for though our country produces every thing, there is no\\ncommodity that we can so well spare. Their talents find them employment\\nevery where; and the necessity they are under of a laborious exertion of\\nthese talents, and of submitting to a great deal from those whose\\ncustoms and manners are not to their taste, and whom they feel inferior\\nto themselves, is a considerable check to the desire to go abroad, so\\nmuch so, that we hold out the farther inducement of political\\ndistinction when they return.\"\\n\\n\"What, then! you have ambition among you?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; our institutions have only tempered it, and not vainly\\nendeavoured to extinguish it; and we find it employment in this way: Of\\nour youthful travellers, those who are most diligent in their vocation;\\nwho give the most useful information, and communicate it in the happiest\\nmanner, are made magistrates, on their return, and sometimes have\\nstatues decreed to them. Besides, the name which their conduct or\\ntalents procure them abroad, is echoed back to the valley, long before\\ntheir return, and has much influence in the general estimate of their\\ncharacter.\\n\\n\"But have you not many more competitors, than you have public offices?\"\\n\\n\"There are, without doubt, many who desire office; but to manifest their\\nwish, would be one of the surest means of defeating it. We require\\nmodesty, (at least in appearance,) moderation and disinterestedness, and\\nof course, the less pains a candidate takes to show himself off,\\nthe better.\"\\n\\n\"But have they no friends, who can at once render them this service, and\\nrelieve them from the odium of it?\"\\n\\n\"There is, indeed, somewhat of this; but you must remember, that the\\nhighest of our magistrates has comparatively little power. He has no\\narmy, no treasury, no patronage; he merely executes the laws. But, as a\\nfarther check on the immoderate zeal of friends, the expense of doing\\nthis, as well as of maintaining him in office, is defrayed by those who\\nvote for him. There seems, at first view, but little justice in this\\nregulation; but we think, that as every one cannot have his way, those\\nwho carry their point, and have the power, should also bear the burden:\\nbesides, in this way the voices of the most generous and disinterested\\nprevail. We have,\" he added, \"found this the most difficult part of our\\ngovernment. We once thought that the very lively interest excited in the\\nelectioneering contests, particularly for that of Gompoo, or chief\\nmagistrate, was to be ascribed to the power he possessed; and we\\nresorted to various expedients to lessen it--such as dividing it among a\\ngreater number--requiring a quick rotation of office--abridging the\\npowers themselves: but we discovered, that however small the power, the\\ndistinction it gave to those who possessed it, was always an object of\\nlively interest with the ambitious, and indeed with the public in\\ngeneral. We have, therefore, enlarged the power, and the term of holding\\nit, and make him who would attain it, purchase it by previous exertion\\nand self-denial: and we farther compel those who favour him, to lose as\\nwell as gain. We array the love of money against the love of power; or\\nrather, one love of power to another. Moreover, as it is only by the\\ncivic virtues that our citizens recommend themselves to popular favour,\\nthere is nothing of that enthusiasm which military success excites among\\nthe natives.\"\\n\\nOur Washington then presented himself to my mind, and for a moment I\\nbegan to question his claim to the unexampled honours bestowed on him by\\nhis countrymen, until I recollected that he was as distinguished by his\\nrespect for the laws, and his sound views of national policy, as for his\\nmilitary services.\\n\\nI then inquired into the occupations and condition of those who were\\nwithout land; and was told that they were either cultivators of the\\nsoil, or practised some liberal or mechanical art; and, partly owing to\\nthe education they receive, and partly from the active competition that\\nexists among them, they are skilful, diligent, and honest. Now and then\\nthere are some exceptions, according to the proverb, that _in the best\\nfield of grain there will be some bad ears_. The land-owners sometimes\\ncultivate the soil with their own hands--sometimes with hired\\nlabourers--and sometimes they rent them for about a third of their\\nproduce. The smallest proprietors commonly adopt the first course; the\\nmiddling, the second; and the great landholders the third.\"\\n\\n\"But I thought,\" said I, \"that all the land in the valley was of equal\\nfertility.\"\\n\\n\"So it is; but what has that to do with rent?\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"our ablest writers on this subject have lately\\ndiscovered that there can be no rent where there is not a gradation of\\nsoils, such as exists in every country of the earth.\"\\n\\n\"I see not,\" said he, \"what could have led them into that error. It is\\ntrue, if there was inferior land, there would be a difference of rent in\\nproportion to the difference of fertility; and if it was so poor as\\nmerely to repay the expense of cultivation, it would yield no rent at\\nall. But surely, if one man makes as much as several consume, (and this\\nhe can easily do with us,) he will be able to get much of their labour\\nin exchange for this surplus, which is so indispensable to them, and to\\nget more and more, until the greatest number has come into existence\\nwhich such surplus can support. What they thus give, if the proprietor\\nretains the land himself, you may regard as the extraordinary profits of\\nagricultural labour, or rent, if paid to any one to whom he transfers\\nthis benefit. This is precisely our present situation.\"\\n\\nThere was no denying this statement of facts: but I could not help\\nexclaiming,--\"Surely there is nothing certain in the universe; or\\nrather, truth is one thing in the moon, and another thing on the earth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n_Farther account of Okalbia--The Field of Roses--Curious superstition\\nconcerning that flower--The pleasures of smell traced to association, by\\na Glonglim philosopher._\\n\\n\\nThough I felt some reluctance to abuse the patience of this polite and\\nintelligent magistrate, I could not help making some inquiry about the\\njurisprudence of his country, and first, what was their system of\\npunishment.\\n\\n\"We have no capital punishment,\" says he; \"for, from all we learn, it is\\nnot more efficacious in preventing crime, than other punishments which\\nare milder; and we prefer making the example to offenders a lasting one.\\nBut we endeavour to prevent offences, not so much by punishment as by\\neducation; and the few crimes committed among us, bring certain censure\\non those who have the early instruction of the criminal. Murders are\\nvery rare with us; thefts and robbery perhaps still more so. Our\\nordinary disputes about property, are commonly settled by arbitration,\\nwhere, as well as in court, each party is permitted to state his case,\\nto examine what witnesses and to ask what questions he pleases.\"\\n\\n\"You do not,\" said I, \"examine witnesses who are interested?\"\\n\\n\"Why not? The judges even examine the parties themselves.\"\\n\\nI then told him that the smallest direct interest in the issue of the\\ncontroversy, disqualified a witness with us, from the strong bias it\\ncreated to misrepresent facts, and even to misconceive them.\\n\\nHe replied with a smile,--\"It seems to me that your extreme fear of\\nhearing falsehood, must often prevent you from ascertaining the truth.\\nIt is true, that wherever the interest of a witness is involved, it has\\nan immediate tendency to make him misstate facts: but so would personal\\nill-will--so would his sympathies--so would any strong feeling. What,\\nthen, is your course in these cases?\"\\n\\nI told him that these objections applied to the credibility, and not to\\nthe competency, of witnesses, which distinctions of the lawyers I\\nendeavoured to explain to him.\\n\\n\"Then I think you often exclude a witness who is under a small bias, and\\nadmit another who is under a great one. You allow a man to give\\ntestimony in a case in which the fortune or character of his father,\\nbrother or child is involved, but reject him in a case in which he is\\nnot interested to the amount of a greater sum than he would give to the\\nfirst beggar he met. Is it not so?\"\\n\\n\"That, indeed, may be the operation of the rule. But cases of such\\nflagrant inconsistency are very rare; and this rule, like every other,\\nmust be tried by its general, and not its partial effects.\"\\n\\n\"True; but your rule must at least be a troublesome one, and give rise\\nto a great many nice distinctions, that make it difficult in the\\napplication. All laws are sufficiently exposed to this evil, and we do\\nnot wish unnecessarily to increase it. We have, therefore, adopted the\\nplan of allowing either party to ask any question of any witness he\\npleases, and leave it to the judges to estimate the circumstances which\\nmay bias the witness. We, in short, pursue the same course in\\ninvestigating facts in court that we pursue out of it, when no one forms\\na judgment until he has first heard what the parties and their friends\\nsay on the subject.\"\\n\\nOn my return home, I repeated this conversation to a lawyer of my\\nacquaintance, who told me that such a rule of evidence might do for the\\npeople in the moon, but it certainly would not suit us. I leave the\\nmatter to be settled by more competent heads than mine, and return to my\\nnarrative.\\n\\nI farther learnt from this intelligent magistrate, that the territory of\\nthe Happy Valley, or Okalbia, is divided into forty-two counties, and\\neach county into ten districts. In each district are three magistrates,\\nwho are appointed by the legislature. Causes of small value are decided\\nby the magistrates of the district; those of greater importance, by the\\ncounty courts, composed of all the magistrates of the ten districts; a\\nfew by the court of last court, consisting of seven judges. The\\nlegislature consists of two houses, of which the members are elected\\nannually, three from each county for one branch, and one member for the\\nother. No qualification of property is required either to vote, or to be\\neligible to either house of the legislature, as they believe that the\\nnatural influence of property is sufficient, without adding to that\\ninfluence by law; and that the moral effects of education among them,\\ntogether with a few provisions in their constitution, are quite\\nsufficient to guard against any improper combination of those who have\\nsmall property. Besides, there are no odious privileges exclusively\\npossessed by particular classes of men, to excite the envy or resentment\\nof the other classes, and induce them to act in concert.\\n\\n\"Have you, then, no parties?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh yes; we are not without our political parties and disputes; and we\\nsometimes wrangle about very small matters--such as, what amount of\\nlabour shall be bestowed on the public roads--the best modes of\\nconducting our schools and colleges--the comparative merits of the\\ncandidates for office, or the policy of some proposed change in the\\nlaws. Man is made, you know, of very combustible materials, and may be\\nkindled as effectually by a spark falling at the right time, in the\\nright place, as when within reach of a great conflagration.\"\\n\\nThe women appeared here to be under few restraints. I understood that\\nthey were taught, like our sex, all the speculative branches of\\nknowledge, but that they were more especially instructed, by professed\\nteachers, in cookery, needlework, and every sort of domestic economy; as\\nwere the young men in the occupations which require strength and\\nexposure. They have a variety of public schools, and some houses for\\npublic festivals, but no public hospitals or almshouses whatever, the\\nfew cases of private distress or misfortune being left for relief to the\\nmerits of the sufferer and the compassion of individuals.\\n\\nAfter passing a week among this singular and fortunate people, whom we\\nevery where found equally amiable, intelligent, and hospitable, we\\nreturned to Alamatua in the same way that we had come; that is, in a\\nlight car, drawn by four large mastiffs. When we had recovered from the\\nfatigues of the journey, and I had carefully committed to paper all that\\nI had learnt of the Okalbians, the Brahmin and I took a walk towards a\\npart of the suburbs which I had not yet seen, and where some of the\\nliterati of his acquaintance resided. The sun appeared to be not more\\nthan two hours high (though, in fact, it was more than fifty); the sky\\nwas without a cloud, and a fresh breeze from the mountains contributed\\nto make it like one of the most delightful summer evenings of a\\ntemperate climate.\\n\\nWe carelessly rambled along, enjoying the balmy freshness of the air,\\nthe picturesque scenery of the neighbouring mountains, the beauty or\\nfragrance of some vegetable productions, and the oddity of others,\\nuntil, having passed through a thick wood, we came to an extensive\\nplain, which was covered with rose-bushes. The queen of flowers here\\nappeared under every variety of colour, size, and species--red, white,\\nblack, and yellow--budding, full-blown, and half-blown;--some with\\nthorns, and some without; some odourless, and others exhaling their\\nunrivalled perfume with an overpowering sweetness. I was about to pluck\\none of these flowers, (of which I have always been particularly fond,)\\nwhen a man, whom I had not previously observed, stepping up behind me,\\nseized my arm, and asked me if I knew what I was doing. He told us that\\nthe roses of this field, which is called Gulgal, were deemed sacred, and\\nwere not allowed to be gathered without the special permission of the\\npriests, under a heavy penalty; and that he was one of those whose duty\\nit was to prevent the violation of the law, and to bring the offenders\\nto punishment.\\n\\nThe Brahmin, having diverted himself a while with my surprise and\\ndisappointment, then informed me, that the rose had ever been regarded\\nin Morosofia, as the symbol of female purity, delicacy, and sweetness;\\nwhich notion had grown into a popular superstition, that whenever a\\nmarriage is consummated on the earth, one of these flowers springs up in\\nthe moon; and that in colour, shape, size, or other property, it is a\\nfit type of the individual whose change of state is thus commemorated.\\n\\n\"What, father,\" said I, \"could have given rise to so strange an\\nopinion?\"\\n\\n\"I know not,\" said he; \"but I have heard it thus explained:--That the\\nroses generally spring up, as well as blow, in the course of their long\\nnights, during which the earth\\'s resplendent disc is the most\\nconspicuous object in the heavens; which two facts stand, in the opinion\\nof the multitude, in the relation of cause and effect. Attributing,\\nthen, the symbolical character of the rose to its tutelary planet, they\\nregard the earth in the same light as the ancients did the chaste Diana,\\nand believe that she plants this her favourite flower in the moon,\\nwhenever she loses a votary. The priesthood encourage this superstition,\\nas they have grafted on it some mystical rites, which add to their power\\nand profit, and which one of our Pundits thinks has a great resemblance\\nto the Eleusinian mysteries. There is, however, my dear Atterley, little\\nsatisfaction in tracing the origin of vulgar superstitions. They grow up\\nlike a strange plant in a forest, without our being able to tell how the\\nseed found its way there. It is generally believed in the east, that the\\nmoon, at particular periods of her revolution round the earth, has a\\ngreat influence in causing rain; though every one must see, that,\\nnotwithstanding such influence must be the same in every part of the\\nearth, it is invariably fair in one place, at the very time that it is\\nrainy in another. Nay, we may safely aver that there is not a day, nor\\nan hour, in the year, in which it is not dry and rainy, cloudy and\\nclear, windy and calm, in hundreds of places at once.\"\\n\\nI told the Brahmin that the same opinion prevailed in my country. That\\nthe vulgar also believe the moon, according to its age, to have\\nparticular effects on the flesh of slaughtered animals; and that all\\nsailors distinguish between a wet and a dry day, according to the\\nposition of the crescent.\\n\\nWe then inquired of the warden of this flowery plain, if he had ever\\nremarked any difference in the number of roses which sprung up in a\\ngiven period of time. He said he thought they were more numerous about\\nfive and twenty or thirty years ago, than he had ever seen them before\\nor since. With that exception, he said, the number appeared to be nearly\\nthe same every year.\\n\\nThe Brahmin happening to be in one of those pleasant moods which are\\noccasionally experienced by amiable tempers, even when under the\\npressure of sorrow and age, now amused himself in pointing out the\\nflowers which probably represented the different nations of the earth;\\nand when he saw any one remarkably small, pale and delicate, he insisted\\nthat it belonged to his own country; which point, however, I, not\\nyielding to him in nationality, warmly contested. I would here remark,\\nthat as the rose is called _gul_ in the Persian language and the ancient\\nSanscrit, the name of this field furnished another argument in support\\nof the Brahmin\\'s hypothesis of the origin of the moon.\\n\\nWhile thus oblivious of the past, and reckless of the future, we were\\nenjoying the present moment in this _badinage_, and I was extolling the\\nodour of the rose, as beyond every other grateful to the olfactory\\nnerves of man, a lively, flippant little personage came up, and accosted\\nthe Brahmin with the familiarity of an acquaintance. My companion\\nimmediately introduced me to him, and at the same time gave me to\\nunderstand that this was the great Reffei, one of the most distinguished\\nliterati of the country. Although his eye was remarkably piercing, I\\nperceived in it somewhat of the wildness which always characterizes a\\nGlonglim. He was evidently impatient for discussion; and having informed\\nhimself of the subject of my rhapsody when he joined our party, he\\nvehemently exclaimed,--\"I am surprised at your falling in with that\\npopular prejudice; while it is easy to show, that but for some feeling\\nof love, or pity, or admiration, with which the rose happens to be\\nassociated--some past pleasure which it brings to your recollection, or\\nsome future pleasure which it suggests,--any other flower would be\\nequally sweet. You see the rose a very beautiful flower; and you have\\nbeen accustomed, whenever you saw and felt its beauty, to perceive, at\\nthe same time, a certain odour. The beauty and the odour thus become\\nassociated in your mind, and the smell brings along with it the pleasure\\nyou feel in looking at it. But the chief part of the gratification you\\nreceive from smelling a rose, arises from some past scene of delight of\\nwhich it reminds you; as, of the days of your innocence and childhood,\\nwhen you ran about the garden--or when you were decorated with\\nnosegays--or danced round a may-pole, (this is rather a free\\ntranslation)--or presented a bunch of flowers to some little favourite.\"\\nHe said a great deal more on the subject, and spoke so prettily and\\ningeniously, as almost to make a convert of me; when, on bringing my\\nnose once more to the flower, I found in it the same exquisite\\nfragrance as ever.\\n\\n\"Why do we like,\" he continued, \"the smell of a beef-steak, or of a cup\\nof tea, except for the pleasure we receive from their taste?\"\\n\\nI mentioned, as an exception to his theory, the codfish, which is\\nesteemed a very savoury dish by my countrymen, but which no one ever\\nregarded as very fragrant. But he repelled my objection by an ingenious\\nhypothesis, grounded on certain physiological facts, to show that this\\nsupposed disagreeable smell was also the effect of some early\\nassociations. I then mentioned to him assafoetida, the odour of which I\\nbelieved was universally odious. He immediately replied, that we are\\nalways accustomed to associate with this drug, the disagreeable ideas of\\nsickness, female weakness, hysterics, affectation, &c. Unable to\\ncontinue the argument, I felt myself vanquished. I again stooped to the\\nflower, and as I inhaled its perfume, \"Surely,\" said I to myself, \"this\\nrose would be sweet if I were to lose my memory altogether:\" but\\nrecollecting the great Reffei\\'s argument, I mentally added thanks to\\ndivine philosophy, which always corrects our natural prejudices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n_Atterley goes to the great monthly fair--Its various exhibitions;\\ndifficulties--Preparations to leave the Moon--Curiosities procured by\\nAtterley--Regress to the Earth._\\n\\n\\nThe philosopher, not waiting to enjoy the triumph of victory, abruptly\\ntook his leave, and we, refreshed and delighted with our walk, returned\\nhome. Our landlord informed us that we had arrived in good time to\\nattend the great fair, or market, which regularly takes place a little\\nbefore the sun sinks below the horizon. Having taken a short repast,\\nwhile the Brahmin called on one of his acquaintance, I sallied forth\\ninto the street, and soon found myself in the bustling throng, who were\\nhastening to this great resort of the busy, the idle, the knavish, and\\nthe gay; some in pursuit of gain, and some of pleasure; whilst others\\nagain, without any settled purpose, were carried along by the vague\\ndesire of meeting with somewhat to relieve them from the pain\\nof idleness.\\n\\nThe fair was held in a large square piece of ground in one of the\\nsuburbs, set apart for that purpose; and on each of its four sides a\\nlong low building, or rather roof, supported on massy white columns,\\nextended about six hundred yards in length, and was thirty yards wide.\\nImmediately within this arcade were arranged the finer kinds of\\nmerchandise, fabrics of cotton or silk, and articles of jewelry,\\ncutlery, porcelain, and glass. On the outside were provisions of every\\nkind, vegetable and animal, flesh, fish, and fowl, as well as the\\ncoarser manufactures. At no great distance from this hollow square,\\n(which was used exclusively for buying and selling,) might be seen an\\ninfinite variety of persons, collected in groupes, all engaged in some\\noccupation or amusement, according to their several tastes and humours.\\nHere a party of young men were jumping, or wrestling, or shooting at a\\nmark with cross-bows. There, girls and boys were dancing to the sound of\\na pipe, or still smaller children were playing at marbles, or amusing\\nthemselves with the toys they had just purchased. Not far from these, a\\nquack from one scaffold was descanting on the virtues of his medicines,\\nwhilst a preacher from another was holding forth to the graver part of\\nthe crowd, the joys and terrors of another life; and yet farther on, a\\nmotley groupe were listening to a blind beggar, who was singing to the\\nmusic of a sort of rude guitar. Here and there curtains, hanging from a\\nslight frame of wood-work, veiled a small square from the eyes of all,\\nexcept those who paid a nail for admittance. Some of these curtained\\nboxes contained jugglers--some tumblers--some libidinous pictures--and\\nothers again, strange birds, beasts, and other animals. I observed that\\nnone of the exhibitions were as much frequented as these booths; and I\\nwas told that the corporation of the city derived from them a\\nconsiderable revenue. Amidst such an infinite variety of objects, my\\nattention was so distracted that it could not settle down upon any one,\\nand I strolled about without object or design.\\n\\nWhen I had become more familiar with this mixed multitude of sights and\\nsounds, I endeavoured to take a closer survey of some of the objects\\ncomposing the medley. The first thing which attracted my particular\\nnotice, was a profusion of oaths and imprecations, which proceeded from\\none of the curtained booths. I paid the admittance money to a\\nwell-dressed man, of smooth, easy manners, and entered. I found there\\nseveral parties paired off, and engaged at different games; but, like\\nthe rest of the bystanders, I felt myself most strongly attracted\\ntowards the two who were betting highest. One of these was an elderly\\nman, of a tall stature, in a plain dress; the other was a short man, in\\nvery costly apparel, and some years younger. For a long time the scales\\nof victory seemed balanced between them; but at length the tall man, who\\nhad great self-possession, and who played with consummate skill, won the\\ngame: soon after which he rose up, and making a graceful, respectful bow\\nto the rest of the company, he retired. Not being able to catch his eye,\\nso intent was he on his game, I felt some curiosity to know whether he\\nwas a Glonglim; but could not ascertain the fact, as some of whom the\\nBrahmin inquired, said that he was, while others maintained that he was\\nnot. His adversary, however, evidently belonged to that class, and, when\\nflushed with hope, reminded me of the feather-hunter. At first he\\nendeavoured, by forced smiles, to conceal his rage and disappointment.\\nHe then bit his lips with vexation, and challenged one of the bystanders\\nto play for a smaller stake. Fortune seemed about to smile on him on\\nthis occasion; but one of the company, who appeared to be very much\\nrespected by the rest, detected the little man in some false play, and\\npublicly exposing him, broke up the game. I understood afterwards, that\\nbefore the fair was over, the gamester avenged himself for this injury\\nin the other\\'s blood: that he then returned to the fair, secretly\\nentered another gambling booth, where he betted so rashly, that he soon\\nlost not only his patrimonial estate, which was large, but his acquired\\nwealth, which was much larger. Having lost all his property, and even\\nhis clothes, he then staked and lost his liberty, and even his teeth,\\nwhich were very good; and he will thus be compelled to live on soups for\\nthe rest of his life.\\n\\nI saw several other matches played, in which great sums were betted,\\ngreat skill was exhibited, and occasionally much unfairness practised.\\nThere was one man in the crowd, whose extraordinary good fortune I could\\nnot but admire. He went about from table to table, sometimes betting\\nhigh and sometimes low, but was generally successful, until he had won\\nas much as he could fairly carry; after which he went out, and amused\\nhimself at a puppet-show, and the stall of a cake-woman, with whom he\\nhad formerly quarrelled, but who now, when she learnt his success, was\\nobsequiously civil to him. I did not see that he manifested superior\\nskill, but still he was successful; and in his last great stake with a\\nyoung, but not inexpert player, he won the game, though the chances were\\nthree to two against him. \"Surely,\" thought I, \"fortune rules the\\ndestinies of man in the moon as well as on the earth.\"\\n\\nOn looking now at my watch, I found that I had been longer a witness of\\nthese trials of skill and fortune, than I had been aware; and on leaving\\nthe booth, perceived that the sun had sunk behind the western mountains,\\nand that the earth began to beam with her nocturnal splendour. Those who\\nhad come from a distance, were already hurrying back with their carts;\\nand here and there light cars, of various forms and colours, and drawn\\nby dogs, were conveying those away whose object had been amusement. Some\\nwere snatching a hasty meal; and a few, by their quiet air, seemed as if\\nthey meant to continue on the spot as long as the regulations permit,\\nafter sunset, which is about twenty of our hours. I found the Brahmin at\\nhome when I returned, and I felt as much pleased to see him, as if we\\nhad not seen each other for many months.\\n\\nAs the shades of night approached, my anxiety to return to my native\\nplanet increased, and I urged my friend to lose no time in preparing for\\nour departure. We were soon afterwards informed that a man high in\\noffice, and renowned for his political sagacity, proposed to detain us,\\non the ground that when such voyages as ours were shown to be\\npracticable, the inhabitants of the earth, who were so much more\\nnumerous than those of the moon, might invade the latter with a large\\narmy, for the purposes of rapine and conquest. We farther learnt that\\nthis opinion, which was at first cautiously circulated in the higher\\ncircles, had become more generally known, and was producing a strong\\nsensation among the people.\\n\\nThe Brahmin immediately presented himself before the council of state,\\nto remove the impression. He pointed out to them the insurmountable\\nobstacles to such an invasion, physical and moral. He urged to them that\\nthe nations of the earth felt so much jealousy and ill-will towards one\\nanother, that they never cordially co-operated in any enterprise for\\ntheir common interest or glory; and that if any one nation were to send\\nan army into the moon, such a scheme of ambition would afford at once a\\ntemptation and pretext for its neighbours to invade it. That his country\\nhad not the ability, and mine had not the inclination, to attack the\\nliberties of any other: so far from that, he informed them, on my\\nauthority, that we were in the habit of sending teachers abroad, to\\ninstruct other nations in the duties of religion, morals, and humanity.\\nHe entered into some calculations, to show that the project was also\\nimpracticable on account of its expense; and, lastly, insisted that if\\nall other difficulties were removed, we should find it impossible to\\nconvince the people of the earth that we had really been to the moon. I\\nhave since found that the Brahmin was more right in his last argument,\\nthan I then believed possible.\\n\\nI am not able to say what effect these representations of the Brahmin\\nwould have produced, if they had not been taken up and enforced by the\\npolitical rival of him who had first opposed our departure; but by his\\npowerful aid they finally triumphed, and we obtained a formal permission\\nto leave the moon whenever, we thought proper.\\n\\nAs we meant to return in the same machine in which we came, we were not\\nlong in preparing for our voyage. We proposed to set out about the\\nmiddle of the night; and we passed the chief part of the interval in\\nmaking visits of ceremony, and in calling on those who had shown us\\ncivility. I endeavoured also, to collect such articles as I thought\\nwould be most curious and rare in my own country, and most likely to\\nproduce conviction with those who might be disposed to question the fact\\nof my voyage. I was obliged, however, to limit myself to such things as\\nwere neither bulky nor weighty, the Brahmin thinking that after we had\\ntaken in our instruments and the necessary provisions, we could not\\nsafely take more than twenty or thirty pounds in addition.\\n\\nSome of my lunar curiosities, which I thought would be most new and\\ninteresting to my countrymen, have proved to be very familiar to our men\\nof science. This has been most remarkably the case with my mineral\\nspecimens. Of the leaves and flowers of above seventy plants, which I\\nbrought, more than forty are found on the earth, and several of these\\ngrow in my native State. With the insects I have been more successful;\\nbut some of these, as well as of the plants, I am assured, are found on\\nthe coasts of the Pacific, or in the islands of that ocean; which fact,\\nby the way, gives a farther support to the Brahmin\\'s hypothesis.\\n\\nBesides the productions of nature that I have mentioned, I procured some\\nspecimens of their cloth, a few light toys, a lady\\'s turban decorated\\nwith cantharides, a pair of slippers with heavy metallic soles, which\\nare used there for walking in a strong wind, and by the dancing girls to\\nprevent their jumping too high. As this metal, which gravitates to the\\nmoon, is repelled from the earth, these slippers assist the wearer here\\nin springing from the ground as much as they impeded it in the moon, and\\ntherefore I have lent them to Madame ----, of the New-York Theatre, who\\nis thus enabled to astonish and delight the spectators with her\\nwonderful lightness and agility.\\n\\nBut there is nothing that I have brought which I prize so highly as a\\nfew of their manuscripts. The Lunarians write as we do, from left to\\nright; but when their words consist of more than one syllable, all the\\nsubsequent syllables are put over the first, so that what we call _long\\nwords_, they call _high_ ones: which mode of writing makes them more\\nstriking to the eye. This peculiarity has, perhaps, had some effect in\\ngiving their writers a magniloquence of style, something like that which\\nso laudably characterises our Fourth of July Orations and Funeral\\nPanegyrics: that composition being thought the finest in which the words\\nstand highest. Another advantage of this mode of writing is, that they\\ncan crowd more in a small page, so that a long discourse, if it is also\\nvery eloquent, may be compressed in a single page. I have left some of\\nthe manuscripts with the publisher of this work, for the gratification\\nof the public curiosity.\\n\\nHaving taken either respectful or affectionate leave of all, and got\\nevery thing in readiness, on the 20th day of August, 1825, about\\nmidnight we again entered our copper balloon, if I may so speak, and\\nrose from the moon with the same velocity as we had formerly ascended\\nfrom the earth. Though I experienced somewhat of my former sensations,\\nwhen I again found myself off the solid ground, yet I soon regained my\\nself-possession; and, animated with the hope of seeing my children and\\ncountry, with the past success of our voyage, and (I will not disguise\\nit,) with the distinction which I expected it would procure me from my\\ncountrymen, I was in excellent spirits. The Brahmin exhibited the same\\nmild equanimity as ever.\\n\\nAs the course of our ascent was now less inclined from the vertical line\\nthan before, in proportion as the motion of the moon on its axis, is\\nslower than that of the earth, we for some hours could see the former,\\nonly by the light reflected from our planet; and although the objects on\\nthe moon\\'s surface were less distinct, they appeared yet more beautiful\\nin my eyes than they had done in the glare of day. The difference,\\nhowever, may be in part attributed to my being now in a better frame of\\nmind for enjoying the scene. As our distance increased, the face of the\\nmoon became of a lighter and more uniform tint, until at length it\\nlooked like one vast lake of melted silver, with here and there small\\npieces of greyish dross floating on it. After contemplating this lovely\\nand magnificent spectacle for about an hour, I turned to the Brahmin,\\nand reminded him of his former promise to give me the history of his\\nearly life. He replied, \"as you have seen all that you can see of the\\nmoon, and the objects of the earth are yet too indistinct to excite much\\ninterest, I am not likely to have a more suitable occasion;\" and after a\\nshort pause, he began in the way that the reader may see in the\\nnext chapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n_The Brahmin gives Atterley a history of his life._\\n\\n\\n\"I have already informed you that I was born at Benares, which, as you\\nknow, is a populous city on the banks of the Ganges, and the most\\ncelebrated seat of Hindoo science and literature. My father was a priest\\nof Vishun, of a high rank; and as his functions required him to live\\nwithin the precincts of the Pagoda, he was liberally maintained out of\\nits ample revenues. I was his only son, and according to the usage of\\nour country, was destined to the same holy calling. At an early age I\\nwas put under a private tutor, and then sent to one of the schools\\nattached to the Pagoda. Upon what little matters, my dear Atterley, do\\nour fortunes, and even our characters depend! Had I been sent to another\\nschool, the whole destiny of my life would have been changed.\\n\\n\"I was in my twelfth year when I entered this school, which contained\\nfrom thirty to forty boys about my age. The cleverest of these was Balty\\nMahu, who, like myself, belonged to the higher order of Brahmins. He\\ntook the lead, not only in the exercises within the school, but in all\\nthe sports and pastimes out of it. Nature, however, had not been equally\\nkind to him in temper and disposition. He was restless, ambitious,\\nproud, vindictive, and implacable. He could occasionally, too, practise\\ncunning and deception; although anger and violence were more congenial\\nto his nature.\\n\\n\"It soon appeared that I was to be his rival in the school, and from\\nthat moment he cordially hated me. The praises that had previously been\\nlavished on him by the teacher, were now shared by me, and most of the\\nboys secretly rejoiced to see his proud spirit humbled. In our sports I\\nwas also his successful competitor. Nature had given me an excellent\\nconstitution; and though I had not a very robust frame, I could boast of\\ngreat agility and flexibility of limbs. When the sun had descended\\nbehind the mountain which screened our play-ground from his evening\\nrays, we commonly amused ourselves in foot-races, and other pastimes, of\\nwhich running was an important part. In this exercise I had no equal. I\\ncould also jump higher and farther than any boy in school, except one,\\nand that one was not Balty Mahu.\\n\\n\"His ill-will was not slow in manifesting itself. He took every occasion\\nof contradicting me: sometimes indulged in sly sneers at my expense, and\\nnow and then even attempted to turn me into open ridicule. I always\\nreplied with spirit; but I found such contests as disagreeable to me as\\nthey were new. One evening, under the pretext that I had purposely\\njostled him in running, he struck me, and we fought. Although he was\\nprobably stronger than I, as he was heavier and older, my suppleness\\nenabled me to get the better of him in a wrestle; and I got him under\\nme, when the master, attracted by the shouts of the boys, made his\\nappearance. He separated and reproved us, and sent us off in disgrace to\\nour respective rooms. From that time Balty Mahu treated me with more\\noutward respect than before; but I believe he hated me with more rancour\\nthan ever.\\n\\n\"I had now become the general favourite of the boys. The school was,\\nindeed, divided into parties, but mine was much the strongest; and of\\nthose who adhered to my rival, very few seemed cordially to dislike me.\\nThough this state of things was very annoying to me, it proved\\nadvantageous in one respect, as it made me more diligent in my studies,\\nlest I should furnish my rival with an occasion of triumphing ever me;\\nso that I owe a part of what I gained to the enmity of my rival.\\n\\n\"When I had reached my sixteenth year, I was removed to the college in\\nBenares. This is commonly a very interesting event in the life of a\\nyouth, as it reminds him that he is drawing near the period of manhood,\\nand leaves him more a master of his actions. But on the present occasion\\nmy pleasure had two drawbacks: I could not but feel the contrast between\\nthe warm and confiding attachment of my late school-fellows, and the\\ncoldness and reserve of my new companions. Yet the most disagreeable\\ncircumstance was, that I here met with my former rival, Balty Mahu. He\\nhad entered the college about a month before me, and, aware of my\\nintention, had spared no pains, as I afterwards learnt, of prejudicing\\nthe students against me.\\n\\n\"After a few months, however, our relative standing was the same here as\\nit had been at the school. I gradually overcame the prejudices of the\\nstudents, and gained their good will, while he was always giving offence\\nby his meddlesome disposition and overbearing manners: yet his talents\\nand force of character always procured him a few followers, whom he\\nmanaged as he pleased. Of their aid he made use to gratify his\\nmalevolence towards me, for this feeling had grown with his growth, and\\nnow seemed to be the master passion of his breast. I was able to trace\\nthe result of their machinations every where. Sometimes it was intimated\\nto the teachers that I had been assisted in my exercises; at others,\\nthat I had infringed the college rules, or had put false reports in\\ncirculation, or had neglected some of the many ceremonies required by\\nour religion. This was their favourite, as well as the most efficient\\nmode of attack, as in these respects there was some colour for their\\naccusation.\\n\\n\"In my early childhood I had been spared, by the tenderest of mothers,\\nfrom many of the ablutions practised by the Hindoos, under the belief\\nthat they would be injurious to my constitution, which, though healthy,\\nhad never been robust. A foundation was thus laid with me for habitual\\nremissness in these ceremonies; and after I grew up, I persuaded myself\\nthat they were of less importance than they were deemed by my\\ncountrymen. My chief delight had ever been in books; and although, when\\nengaged in active pursuits, I took a lively interest in them for the\\ntime, I always returned to my first love with unabated ardour.\\n\\n\"Some of these accusations, being utterly groundless, I was able to\\ndisprove; but the few that were true I endeavoured to excuse, and thus,\\nby their admission, credit was procured for their most unfounded\\ncalumny. These petty transgressions, (for I cannot even now regard them\\nas sins,) industriously reported and artfully exaggerated, did me\\nlasting injury with all the most pious of our caste. The charitable\\nportion, indeed, were merely estranged from me; but the more bigoted\\npart began to regard me with aversion and horror.\\n\\n\"In one of our vacations, my father allowed me to visit a brother of\\nhis, who lived in the country, about thirty miles from Benares. My uncle\\nhad two sons, of nearly my own age, and several daughters. With the\\nformer I rode, played chess, and engaged in such sports as are not\\nforbidden to my profession; but my female cousins I seldom saw, as they\\nrarely left their Zenana, into which I was not permitted to enter. I was\\nof an age to be desirous of becoming better acquainted with my female\\ncousins, especially after I learnt that they then had as guests, a lady\\nand her daughter, who had come to pass some weeks here during the\\nabsence of her husband, then employed in some public mission to\\nCalcutta. But it was only now and then that I had been able to catch a\\ntransient and distant view of these females, during the first week after\\nmy arrival; and the little I saw, served but to increase my curiosity.\\nChance, however, soon afforded me the means of gratifying it.\\n\\n\"An important festival in our calendar was now approaching, and\\npreparations were made to celebrate it in various modes, and, amongst\\nothers, by a fight between a _royal_ tiger and an elephant. For several\\ndays all was bustle and confusion in my uncle\\'s family. Howdahs, newly\\ngilded and painted, were provided for the elephants--new caparisons for\\nthe horses--new liveries for the attendants--cloth and silk, of the\\nrichest dyes and hues, united with a profusion of gold and silver\\nornaments, to dazzle the eye with their varied splendour. This was one\\nof those exhibitions, which those who were intended for the priesthood,\\nwere prohibited from attending. I confess, when I witnessed these showy\\nand costly preparations, and pictured to myself the magnificent scene\\nfor which they were intended--those formidable animals contending in\\nmortal conflict--the thousands of gaily dressed spectators, gazing in\\nbreathless anxiety,--I repined at my lot, and regretted I had not been\\nborn in a condition which, though of less dignity, would not have cut me\\noff from some of the most exquisite pleasures of life. At length the\\nimportant day arrived, and I found my mortification so acute, that I\\ndetermined to withdraw myself, as much as I could, from a scene that I\\ncould not witness without pain. Among my acquirements at college, was a\\nknowledge of your language; and I had now begun to take the liveliest\\ninterest in its beautiful fictions, which I greatly preferred to ours,\\nas being more true to nature, and as exhibiting women in characters at\\nonce lovely, pure, and elevated. I was then reading \"The Vicar of\\nWakefield,\" and had reached the middle of that interesting tale, on the\\nmorning of the festival, when my tranquillity was interrupted in the way\\nI have mentioned. Accordingly, taking my book and English dictionary, I\\nretired to a small summer-house at the foot of the garden, and\\ndetermined to remain there till the cavalcade had set out. It was some\\ntime before I could fix my attention on what I read; but after a while,\\nthe interest the book had previously excited returned, and I became at\\nlength so engrossed by the incidents of the story, as to forget the\\nfestival, the procession, the tiger, and the elephant, as much as if\\nthey had never before entered my head.\\n\\n\"After some hours passed in this intellectual banquet, I waked from my\\nday dream, and I thought again of the spectacle with a feeling bordering\\non indifference. I walked towards the house, where all appeared to be\\nstill and silent as a desert. I entered it, and of the forty or fifty\\nmenials belonging to it, not one was to be seen. Those who were not in\\nattendance on the family, had sought some respite from their ordinary\\nlabours. The Zenana then caught my eye, and I felt irresistibly impelled\\nto enter it. I used great caution, however, looking around me in every\\ndirection as I proceeded there. I found the same silence and desertion\\nas in the other parts of the mansion. I passed through a sitting-room\\ninto a long gallery, with which the bed-chambers of the ladies\\ncommunicated. The doors were all open, and the whole interior of their\\napartments exhibited so strange a medley of unseemly objects, and such\\nutter disorder, as materially to affect my opinion of female delicacy,\\nand to damp my desire of becoming acquainted with my cousins. I passed\\non, with a feeling of disappointment bordering on disgust, when I came\\nto a room which went far to redeem the character of the sex in my\\nestimation. Here all was neatness and propriety: every thing was either\\nin place, or only enough out of it to indicate the recent occupation of\\nthe room, or to show the taste or talent of the occupant; such as a book\\nleft half open at one end of an ottoman, and a piece of embroidery at\\nthe other. The flowers too, which decorated the room, showed by their\\nfreshness that they had not long left their beds. I could not help\\nstopping to survey a scene which accorded so well with my previous\\nnotions of female refinement. At the end of the gallery was a veranda,\\nfacing the east, and surrounded by lattices. In this were a number of\\nflower-pots, arranged with the same air of neatness and taste as had\\nbeen conspicuous in the chamber. I entered it, for the purpose of\\nlooking into the flower-garden, with which it communicated; and on\\napproaching the lattice, I saw, seated in an alcove not far from the\\nveranda, a face and form that struck me as being the most beautiful I\\nhad ever beheld. I remained for some time riveted to the spot, but soon\\nfound myself irresistibly impelled to get a nearer view of the lovely\\nobject. With as light a step and as little noise as possible, I\\ndescended into the garden from the veranda, and approaching the alcove\\non the side where its foliage was thickest, I found that the beauty, of\\nwhich I had before thought so highly, did not appear less on a closer\\nsurvey. The vision on which I gazed in silent rapture, a maiden, who,\\nthough she had apparently attained her full stature, did not seem to be\\nmore than thirteen or fourteen years of age. Her eyes had the brightness\\nand fulness of the antelope\\'s, but, owing to their long silken lashes,\\nwere yet more expressive of softness than of spirit; and at this time\\nthey evinced more than usual languor. She was in a rich undress, and was\\napparently an invalid. Her long raven locks hung with careless grace,\\npartly behind, and partly over, a neck that might have served as a model\\nfor the sculptor. She was looking wistfully on a bunch of flowers in her\\nhand, which I felt pleasure in recognising to be the same I had seen on\\nthe piece of embroidery. I feared to advance, lest I should give\\noffence; but I felt also unable to retreat. I fancied I saw one of those\\nlovely and dignified females which the writers in your language describe\\nso well. But a sudden movement of the fair damsel to get up, bringing me\\nfull in her view, she started back with alarm and surprise, and in a\\nmoment afterwards her cheek, which had been before pale, almost to\\nEuropean whiteness, was deeply suffused. I respectfully approached her,\\nand inquired if she was one of my cousins. She answered in the negative;\\nsaid she was on a visit to the family, to whom she was related: added\\nthat she had not expected to see any one in the garden; but this was\\nsaid as if she meant rather to apologise for her undress, than to\\nreproach me for my intrusion. These remarks were uttered with a\\npropriety and sweetness that won upon me yet more than her beauty. I\\nthen, in return, assured her that I had not supposed any of the family\\nhad remained at home, when I strolled to this part of the mansion. I\\nbegged she would not regard me with the formality of a stranger; and\\ninsisted that, as she was the cousin of my relation, she was also mine.\\nTo this ingenious argument she answered with so much good sense, and at\\nthe same time, so much gentleness and artlessness, that I thought I\\ncould have listened to her for ever. While I spoke, she continued to\\nmove on. I entreated to know if she was satisfied with my apology;\\nrepeated that I had not meant to intrude on her privacy. She mildly\\nreplied that she was. I then asked permission to call her cousin. She\\nsaid she should not object, if it would gave me pleasure. It was, my\\ndear Atterley, her ineffable sweetness of disposition, and of manners so\\nentirely free from pride, coquetry, or affectation, in which this lovely\\ncreature excelled all other women, yet more than in beauty and grace. I\\nthen inquired when I should again see my lovely cousin. She replied, \"I\\nwalk in the great garden sometimes with my companions, when their\\nbrothers are away; but the girls will not think it proper to walk when\\nyou are there.\" Perceiving that I looked chagrined, she added: \"It is\\nsaid, you know, that the light from mens\\' eyes is yet worse for womens\\'\\nfaces than the light of the sun;\" and she blushed as if she had said\\nsomething wrong. I stammered out I know not what extravagant compliment\\nin reply, and entreated that I might have an opportunity of seeing and\\nconversing with her sometimes: to which she promptly answered that she\\nshould not object, if her mother approved it. I inquired why she had not\\nattended the exhibition; when I learnt from her, that, as she had been\\nslightly indisposed the day before, and her mother being unwilling she\\nshould expose herself to the heat of the weather and the crowd, she had\\nbeen left under the care of her nurse; but that finding herself better,\\nshe had permitted her attendants to walk over the grounds, while she\\namused herself in embroidery; and that she had come into the garden to\\nget a fresh supply of the flowers she was working.\\n\\n\"She had by this time approached a small gate, which communicated with\\nthe apartments on the ground-floor of the Zenana; when, turning to me,\\nshe said, \"You can return the way you came, but I must leave you here;\"\\nand, making a slight bow, she sprung like a young fawn through the gate,\\nand was out of sight in a moment.\\n\\n\"You may wonder, my dear Atterley, that I should remember all these\\nminute circumstances, after the lapse of more than forty years; but\\nevery incident of that day is as fresh in my memory as the occurrence of\\nyesterday. To this single green spot in my existence, my mind is never\\ntired of returning.\\n\\n\"I continued for some time in a sort of dreaming ecstasy; but as soon as\\nI collected my thoughts, I began to devise some scheme by which I could\\nagain have the happiness of seeing and conversing with the lovely\\nVeenah. My brain had before that time teemed with ambitious projects of\\ndistinguishing myself; sometimes as a priest--sometimes as a writer; and\\noccasionally I thought I would bend all my efforts to rouse my\\ncountrymen to throw off the ignominious yoke of Great Britain. But this\\nshort interview had changed the whole current of my thoughts. I had now\\na new set of feelings, opinions, and wishes. My mind dwelt solely upon\\nthe pleasures of domestic life--the surpassing bliss of loving and of\\nbeing beloved.\\n\\n\"When the cavalcade returned in the evening, its gaudy magnificence,\\nwhich I would not permit myself even to see in the morning, I now\\nregarded with cold indifference; nay, more, I congratulated myself on\\nhaving missed the exhibition, though a few hours before I had deemed\\nthis privation one of the misfortunes of my life.\\n\\n\"The next day I went to the garden betimes; and as it communicated with\\nthe shrubbery and grounds attached to the Zenana, and the males of the\\nfamily occasionally entered it when the ladies were not present, I\\nprevailed on the gardener to grant me admission, under the pretext of\\ngathering some uncommonly fine mangoes, which were then ripe. I went to\\nthe several spots where I had first seen Veenah--where I had conversed\\nwith her--where I had parted from her; and they each had some secret and\\nindescribable charm for me. I fear, Atterley, I fatigue you. The\\nfeelings of which I speak, are fully known only to the natives of warm\\nclimates, and to those but once in their lives.\"\\n\\nI assured him that he was mistaken; that the emotions he described, were\\nthe same in all countries, and at all times, and begged him to proceed.\\n\\n\"I repeated my visit,\" he continued, \"several times the same day, under\\nany pretext I could invent--to gather an orange, or other fruit--to\\npluck a rose--to frighten away mischievous birds--to catch the\\nunobstructed breeze, or sit in a cooler shade; in which artifices I\\nplayed a part that had before been foreign to my nature. I was\\ndisappointed, however, in my wishes. I thought, indeed, I once saw some\\none in the veranda, looking through the lattice into the garden, but the\\nfigure soon disappeared.\\n\\n\"On the following day I had the satisfaction to hear my young companions\\npropose to go on a fishing party, an amusement in which, by the rules of\\nmy caste, I was not allowed to partake. They had scarcely left the house\\nbefore I flew to the garden with a book in my hand, and passing as\\nbefore to the shrubbery, I buried myself in a close thicket at one end\\nof it. I remained there from the morning till late in the afternoon,\\nwithout refreshment of any kind; and such was the intensity of my\\nemotion, that I did not feel the want of it. At length, a little before\\nsunset, I saw Veenah and her three cousins enter the garden. I soon\\ncontrived to show myself, with my book in my hand. I approached, bowed\\nto them all, but to Veenah last; and although my cousins showed surprise\\nat seeing me in their garden, at this time, they did not seem\\ndispleased. I felt very desirous, I could not tell why, to conceal my\\nfeelings from every person except her who was the object of them. I\\nforced a conversation with my two eldest cousins, who were modest\\npleasing girls, and then with an embarrassed air addressed a few words\\nto Veenah and her companion, the youngest of my cousins. Occasionally I\\nwould stray off from them as if I was about to leave them, and then\\nsuddenly return. In one of these movements, I perceived that Veenah and\\nher associate had separated from the others, and strolled to a distant\\npart of the garden. I soon joined them as if it were by accident,\\nentered into conversation with them alternately, and of course only one\\nhalf of that which I either heard or said proceeded from the heart or\\nfound its way thither. I know not if Veenah expected to see me, but she\\nwas dressed with unusual care. We had not been conversing many minutes\\nbefore the eldest sister beckoning to them, they bid me good night and\\nreturned to the house.\\n\\n\"To the same sort of management I had recourse every day, and seldom\\nfailed to see and converse with Veenah, sometimes in company with all\\nher cousins, but oftener with Fatima, the youngest. By dividing my\\nattentions among them all, I succeeded for a while in concealing from\\nthem the object of my preference; but the sex are too sharp-sighted to\\nbe long deceived in these matters. As soon as I perceived that my secret\\nwas discovered, I endeavoured to make a friend of Fatima, in which I was\\nsuccessful. After this our meetings were more frequent, and what was of\\ngreater importance, they were uninterrupted. Fatima, who was one of the\\nmost generous and amiable girls in the world, would often take Veenah\\nout to walk, when her sisters were otherwise engaged; at which times she\\nwas perpetually contriving, under some little pretext, to leave us\\nalone. We were not long in understanding each other; and when I urged\\nour early marriage, she ingenuously replied, that I had her consent\\nwhenever I had her father\\'s, and that she hoped I could obtain that; but\\nadded, (and she trembled while she spoke) she did not know his views\\nrespecting her. In the first raptures of requited affection, what lover\\nthinks of difficulties? In obtaining Veenah\\'s heart I believed that all\\nmine were at an end, and my time was passed in one dream of unmixed\\ndelight. Oh! what happiness I enjoyed in these interviews--in seeing\\nVeenah--in gazing on her lovely features--in listening to her\\nsentiments, that were sometimes gay and thoughtless, sometimes serious\\nand melancholy, but always tender and affectionate,--and now and then,\\nwhen not perceived, in venturing to take her hand. These fleeting joys\\nare ever recurring to my imagination, to show me what my lot might have\\nbeen, and to contrast it with its sad reverse!\\n\\n\"The time now approached for Veenah and her mother to return to Benares.\\nOn the evening before they set out, Fatima contrived for us a longer\\ninterview than usual. It was as melancholy as it was tender. But in the\\nmidst of my grief, at the prospect of our separation, I recollected that\\nwe were soon to meet again in the city; while Veenah\\'s tears, for she\\ndid not attempt to disguise or suppress her feelings, seemed already to\\nforebode that our happiness was here to terminate.\\n\\n\"When about to part, we exchanged amaranths I took her hand to bid her\\nadieu, and, without seeming to intend it, our lips met, and the first\\nkiss of love was moistened with a tear. Pardon me, Atterley, nature will\\nhave her way.\"--And here the venerable man wept aloud.\\n\\nI availed myself of this interruption to the narrative, to propose to my\\nvenerable friend to take some refreshment. Having partaken of a frugal\\nrepast, and invigorated ourselves, each with about four hours sleep, the\\nBrahmin thus resumed his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n_The Brahmin\\'s story continued--The voyage concluded--Atterley and the\\nBrahmin separate--Atterley arrives in New--York._\\n\\n\\n\"I was not slow to follow Veenah to the city, and as had been agreed\\nupon, had to ask the consent of her father to our union, as soon as I\\nhad obtained the approbation of my own. Here I met with a difficulty\\nwhich I had not expected. My partial father had formed very high hopes\\nof my future advancement, and thought that an early marriage, though not\\nincompatible with my profession, or a successful discharge of its\\nduties, would put an end to my ambition, or at all events, lessen my\\nexertions. He first urged me to postpone my wishes, till I had completed\\nmy college course, and had by travelling seen something of the world.\\nBut finding me immoveable on this point, he then suggested that I might\\nmeet with serious obstacles from Veenah\\'s father, whom he represented as\\nremarkable both for his avarice and his bigotry; that consequently he\\nwas likely to dispose of his daughter to the son-in-law who could pay\\nmost liberally for her; and that the imputations which had been cast on\\nmy religious creed, would reach his ears, if they had not already done\\nso, and be sure to prejudice him against me.\\n\\n\"These last considerations prevailed on me to defer my application to\\nShunah Shoo, until the suspicions regarding my faith had either died\\naway, or been falsified by my scrupulous observance of all religious\\nduties. My excellent mother, who at first had entered into my feelings\\nand seconded my views, readily acquiesced in the good sense of my\\nfather\\'s advice.\\n\\n\"My next object was to communicate this to Veenah. I accordingly sat\\ndown, and wrote a full account of all that had occurred, and folding up\\nthe packet, hurried to the opposite quarter of the town where Shunah\\nShoo lived. It was then in the dusk of the evening, and I was fearful it\\nwas too late for me to be recognised; but after I had taken two or three\\nturns in the street, I saw the white amaranth I had given Veenah,\\nsuspended by a thread from the lattice of an upper window. I immediately\\nheld up the packet, and soon afterwards a cord was let down from the\\nsame lattice to the ground. To this I hastily fastened the paper, and\\npassed on to avoid observation. The next evening you may be sure I was\\nat the same spot. The little amaranth again announced that I was\\nrecognised; and as soon as we were satisfied that no one was observing\\nus, the cord let down one letter and took up another. Veenah\\'s pen had\\ngiven an expression to her feelings, that her tongue had never ventured\\nto do before. She moreover commended my course--besought me to be\\nprudent--and above all, to do nothing to offend her father.\\n\\n\"The first letter which a lover receives from his mistress, is a new era\\nin his life. Again and again I kissed the precious paper, and almost\\nwore it out in my bosom. We afterwards improved in this mode of\\nintercourse, and, by various preconcerted signals, were able to carry on\\nour correspondence altogether in the night. Not a day passed that we did\\nnot exchange letters, which, though they contained few facts, and always\\nexpressed the same sentiments, still repeated what we were never tired\\nof hearing. To the moment at which I was to receive a letter from\\nVeenah, my thoughts were continually and anxiously turned: and it now\\nseems to me as if our passion was inflamed yet more by this sort of\\nintercourse, than by our personal interviews. I am convinced it wrought\\nmore powerfully upon our imaginations. In the mean time I continued my\\ndaily attendance at college, though my studies were utterly neglected,\\none single object absorbing all my thoughts and feelings.\\n\\n\"I know not whether the evident change in my habits induced my old\\nenemy, Balty Mahu, to observe my motions. But so it was, that one\\nmoonlight night I thought I was watched by some person; and on the\\nfollowing night an individual of the same figure, and whom I now\\nsuspected to be Balty Mahu, came suddenly from a cross street, and\\npassed near me. A few evenings afterwards, instead of a letter, I\\nreceived a scrap of paper from Veenah, on which was written the\\nfollowing words:--\\n\\n\"We are discovered. Balty Mahu, who is my relative and your enemy, has\\nbeen here. He has persuaded my father that you are an unbeliever. I am\\ndenied pen and ink. If you cannot convince my father of his error, O!\\npity, and try to forget, your unhappy VEENAH.\"\\n\\n\"This writing was indistinctly traced with a burnt stick, on a blank\\nleaf torn out of a book. In the first moment of indignation, I felt\\ndisposed to seek Balty Mahu, the great enemy of my life, and wreak my\\nvengeance on him for all his persecutions; but the conviction that such\\na course would extinguish the last spark of hope, restrained me. I then\\ndetermined to see Shunah Shoo, and endeavour to remove his prejudices. I\\naccordingly called on him at his own house: but after he had heard my\\nvindication, (to which he evidently gave no credit,) he coolly told me\\nthat he meant to dispose of his daughter in another way. The words fell\\nlike ice upon my heart. I expostulated; and, offensive as was his\\nhaughty air, even had recourse to entreaty. But he, in a yet harsher\\nmanner, told me that he must be permitted to manage his own affairs in\\nhis own way; and added, that he did not wish to be longer prevented from\\nattending to them. I was compelled to retire, with my heart almost as\\nfull of hatred for the father, as of love for the child.\\n\\n\"On the same night, I again betook myself to the street in which Shunah\\nShoo lived, but not by the ordinary route. I cautiously approached his\\nhouse. All was stillness and quiet: no light appeared to be burning in\\nVeenah\\'s room, nor indeed in any other part of the house. I hence\\nconcluded that they had now deprived her of light, as well as of pen and\\nink. I continued in the street until near morning, straining my eyes and\\nears in the hope of catching something that would give me intelligence\\nconcerning her. Often, in the course of that painful suspense, did I\\nfancy I heard a noise at the lattice in Veenah\\'s apartment, or in some\\nother part of the mansion; and once I persuaded myself I saw a light:\\nbut these illusions served only to aggravate my disappointment. The next\\nmorning, before I had left my room, my father informed me that Shunah\\nShoo, with his family, had left Benares early the preceding evening; but\\nwhither they had gone, he had not learnt.\\n\\n\"I rose, and immediately set about discovering their course; but all I\\ncould learn was, that they had embarked in one of the passage-boats\\nwhich ply on the Ganges, and that Shunah had taken his palanquins and\\nmany of his servants with him: and, as Balty Mahu had suddenly absented\\nhimself from college at the same time, I did not doubt that he had aided\\nin executing the plan which he had also probably formed. My father, who\\nsaw what I suffered, spared no pains to discover the place of their\\nretreat; but our endeavours were all ineffectual.\\n\\n\"At the end of three months, in which time my anxiety increased rather\\nthan diminished, the mystery was dispelled. It was now trumpeted through\\nthe city, that Shunah Shoo had returned to Benares in great pomp,\\naccompanied by a wealthy Omrah of a neighbouring district, to whom he\\nhad given, or rather sold, his daughter. The news came upon me like a\\nclap of thunder. My previous state of suspense was happiness compared\\nwith what I now felt, when I knew she was in the arms of another. In the\\nfirst transports of my grief and rage, I could have freely put to death\\nthe father, daughter, husband, and myself. I was particularly desirous\\nof seeing Veenah, and venting on her the bitterest reproaches. Unjust\\nthat I was! Her sufferings were not inferior to mine; but she had not,\\nlike me, the privilege of making them known. I soon found that\\nHircarrahs, in the pay of Balty Mahu, watched all my motions; and if I\\nhad attempted any scheme of vengeance, its execution would have been\\nimpracticable.\\n\\n\"After my first transports had subsided into deep and settled grief, my\\nlove and tenderness for Veenah returned in full force. I endeavoured to\\nget a sight of her, and thought I should be comparatively happy if I\\ncould converse with her, as formerly, though she was the wife of\\nanother. After a short time, my uncle\\'s family came to Benares, on a\\nvisit to my father and to Shunah Shoo. By the aid of my indulgent\\nmother, who was seriously alarmed for what she saw I suffered, I was\\nable to see Fatima, and to make her the bearer of a letter to Veenah,\\ncomplaining of her breach of faith, and soliciting an interview. She\\nverbally replied to it through Fatima; and stated, in her justification,\\nthat she was hurried from Benares to a town on the river, whence she was\\nrapidly transported to the castle of Omrah, who had not long before lost\\nhis wife, and who was more than four times her age. That notwithstanding\\nthe notions of filial obedience in which she had been brought up, and\\nthe severity with which her father had ever exercised his authority, she\\nhad resisted his commands on this occasion, and would have preferred\\ndeath to marrying the Omrah--nay, would have inflicted it on herself;\\nbut that finding her unyielding after all their exertions, they had\\neffected their purpose by a deception which they had practised on her,\\nwherein it seemed that I had unconsciously concurred; for, by means of\\nan intercepted letter of mine to Fatima, in which, hopeless of learning\\nthe place of Veenah\\'s retreat, I had expressed an intention of visiting\\nEngland; and, by the farther aid of some dexterous forgeries, calculated\\nto impose on more experienced minds than hers, they succeeded in\\npersuading her that I had actually set out for Europe, with an intention\\nof never returning. That entertaining no doubt of this intelligence\\n--hopeless of ever seeing me again, and indifferent to every\\nthing besides, she had been led an unresisting victim to the altar.\\n\\n\"Such was the vindication which she considered it just to make me. But\\nall the entreaties of Fatima--all my letters, impassioned as they were,\\nappealing at once to her generosity, humanity, and love,--could not\\nprevail on her to grant me an interview.\\n\\n\"\\'Tell him,\\' said she, \\'that heaven has forbid it, and to its decrees we\\nare bound to submit. I am now the wife of another, and it is our duty to\\nforget all that is past. But if this be possible, my heart tells me it\\ncan be only by our never meeting!\\'\\n\\n\"In saying this, she wept bitterly; but at the same time exacted a\\npromise from Fatima, that she would never mention the subject to her\\nagain. Finding her thus inexorable, I fell into a settled melancholy,\\nand my health was visibly declining. The Europeans consider the natives\\nof Hindostan to be feeble and effeminate; but the soul, that which\\ndistinguishes man from brutes, acts with an intensity and constancy of\\npurpose of which they can furnish no examples.\\n\\n\"How long I could have withstood the corrosive effects of my hopeless\\npassion, irritated as it was by my being in the vicinity of its\\nobject--by hearing perpetually of her beauty, and sometimes catching a\\nglimpse of it,--I know not; but the Omrah, after a few months spent with\\nhis father-in-law, returned with his bride to his castle in the country.\\nYielding now to the wishes of my anxious parents, I consented to travel.\\nI was at first benefited by the exercise and change of scene; but after\\na while, my melancholy returned, and my health grew worse. Though\\nindifferent to life itself, and all that it now promised, I exerted\\nmyself for the sake of my parents, especially of my mother, who suffered\\nso acutely on my account: but I carried a barbed arrow in my heart, and\\nthe greater the efforts to extract it, the more they rankled the wound.\\n\\n\"After spending more than a year in travelling, first through the\\nmountainous district of our country, and then along the coast, and\\nfinding no change for the better, I determined to try the effect of a\\nsea voyage. I accordingly embarked at Calcutta, in a coasting vessel\\nthat was bound to Madras. At this time I had wasted away to a mere\\nskeleton, and no one who saw me, believed I could live a month. Such,\\nindeed, were my own impressions. In the letter which I wrote to my\\nparents, I endeavoured to prepare them for the worst. When, after a long\\nvoyage, we reached Madras, my health was evidently improved; but a piece\\nof intelligence I here received, had perhaps a still greater effect I\\nlearnt that Balty Mahu, who had kept himself concealed from me before I\\nleft Benares, had lately visited Madras, on a travelling tour. This news\\noperated on me like a charm. The idea of avenging myself on the author\\nof all my calamities, infused new life into my exhausted frame, and from\\nthe moment that I determined to pursue him, I felt like another man.\\n\\n\"You must not, however, suppose that I even then entertained the purpose\\nof taking away my enemy\\'s life. No, I could not bring my mind exactly to\\nthat; but I had a vague, undefined hope, that if we met, some new\\nprovocation on his part would afford me just occasion for avenging\\nmyself on all; so ingenious, my dear friend, is the sophistry of\\nthe passions.\\n\\n\"I lost no time in setting out on the track of Balty Mahu, and, ere many\\ndays, overtook him at a small town which he had left just as I entered\\nit, but not before he had received, through his servant, notice of my\\narrival. My wary enemy, who had little expected to see me here, and who\\nhad travelled as much to keep out of my way as to see the country,\\nconjectured my purpose, from the consciousness of what he had done to\\nprovoke it. Thus, while we both appeared to others to be merely making a\\ntour of Hindostan, it was soon known to both of us, that my chief\\npurpose was to pursue him, and his to elude my pursuit. In the ardour,\\nas well as exercise of the chase, my health mended rapidly, but I was no\\nnearer the object of my pursuit; for, although I travelled somewhat\\nfaster than Bally Mahu, as he wished to avoid the appearance of flying\\nfrom me, he sometimes contrived to put me on a wrong track. In this way\\nI was once led to travel towards the coast, while he proceeded in an\\nopposite direction to Benares, where he considered he would be most safe\\nfrom my vengeance, and where the restraints both of religion and law\\nwould be more likely to operate on me than in a foreign district.\\n\\n\"My usual practice, on arriving at any town, was to endeavour to learn\\nif Balty Mahu had passed through it; if so, when and in what direction;\\nand to get the information, if possible, without seeming to seek it. On\\none of these occasions, I heard from a party of merchants that the Omrah\\nAddaway, whose health had been declining for some time, had gone to\\nBenares, for the benefit of medical advice; that his disease, however,\\nhad become more serious; and that it was generally thought it would soon\\noccasion his death. What a train of new thoughts, hopes, and desires,\\ndid this intelligence excite in me! At first, influenced by the custom\\nof my country, which prohibits widows from marrying again, I thought\\nonly of the pleasure of Veenah\\'s society, which I should, of course, be\\npermitted to enjoy, when duty no longer forbade it; but my imagination\\nkindling in its course, I soon pictured her to myself as my wife. The\\nusages which stood in the way of our union, appeared to me barbarous and\\nabsurd, and I thought that, banishment from my country, with Veenah,\\nwould be infinitely better than any other condition of life without her.\\nThese new-born visions so entirely absorbed me, that Balty Mahu was\\nentirely forgotten, or remembered only as we think of an insect which\\nhad stung us an hour before. I travelled on at a yet more rapid rate\\nthan I had done; and, without stopping on the road to make inquiries, I\\nheard enough to satisfy me that the Omrah could not long survive. When\\nwithin something more than ten leagues of Benares, I called, about\\ntwilight, at a small inn, and meant, after refreshing myself with a few\\nhours\\' rest, to proceed on my journey. Two travellers were there, who\\nhad just left Benares, and had taken up their quarters for the night.\\nThey soon fell into conversation about the place they had left, when the\\nmention of Shunah Shoo\\'s name excited my attention.\\n\\n\"\\'What a shame,\\' said one, \\'that he should have sacrificed that\\nbeautiful young creature to the rich old Omrah, when she had so good an\\noffer as Gurameer, the Brahmin Gafawad\\'s only son.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'And is it not strange,\\' said the other, \\'that a woman so young and\\nbeautiful, should be content to follow to the grave one who is old\\nenough to be her grandfather, and whom she once loathed? But I suppose\\nthat that old miser, Shunah Shoo, is at the bottom of it; and, as he\\ndeprived her of the man she loved, he has compelled her to sacrifice\\nherself to the one she hates, that he may have her jewels and wealth.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'For that matter,\\' said the first, \\'though Shunah Shoo is bad enough\\nfor any thing where money is in the way, yet it is said that Veenah goes\\nto the funeral pile of her own accord. She has never seemed to set any\\nvalue on life since her marriage; and after she heard of Gurameer\\'s\\ndeath, she has never been seen to smile. Poor young man!\\'--And here they\\nlaunched out into a strain of panegyric, which is often bestowed on the\\ndead; but I heeded only the first part of their discourse. Had it not\\nbeen nearly dark, they must have discovered the force of the feelings\\nwhich then agitated me. I trembled from head to foot, and, though\\nburning with impatience to obtain from them farther particulars, it was\\nsome moments before I could trust myself to speak. At length I asked\\nthem when the Suttee would take place; and was answered by one of them,\\nthat it would certainly be performed on the following day; and that he\\nhad seen the funeral pile himself. Without any farther delay, I set out\\nimmediately for the city, and reached it in as short a time as a jaded\\nhorse could carry me.\\n\\n\"I came in sight of Benares the next morning, from a hill which\\noverlooks it from the east. The sun was just rising, and pouring a flood\\nof light ever the city, the river, and the surrounding country. Never\\nwas contrast greater than between my present feelings, and those which\\nthe same spectacle had formerly excited. I now sickened at the prospect,\\nwhich once would have set my heart bounding with joy. I pressed on in\\ndesperate haste, scarcely, however, knowing what I did, being at once\\noverpowered with fatigue, loss of sleep, and harassing emotions. I still\\nhad to travel a circuitous course of some two or three miles; and when I\\nreached the city, its crowded population was already in motion: a great\\nmultitude of women, of the lower order, with alarm and expectation\\nstrongly depicted in their faces, were to be seen mingling in the crowd,\\nand pressing on in the same direction. I would have proceeded\\nimmediately to my father\\'s house, but for the fear of being too late.\\nAlighting, therefore, from my horse, I gave him in charge to my servant,\\nwhom I sent to inform my parents of my arrival, and to request my father\\nto meet me at the Suttee. I then joined the mixed multitude, which now\\nthronged the streets. Occupied, as my thoughts were, with the scene I\\nwas about to witness, and with fears for its issue, they were often\\ninterrupted with remarks made in the crowd, in which Veenah\\'s name or\\nmine were mentioned--some lamenting her cruel fate, others pitying mine;\\nbut all condemning and execrating Shunah Shoo. Fortunately I was not\\nrecognised by any whom I saw. When we reached the spot selected for the\\nsacrifice, the crowd that had there assembled, was not so great as to\\nprevent our getting near the funeral pile; but the numbers continued to\\naugment, until nothing could be seen from the slight eminence on which I\\nstood, but one dense mass of heads, all looking one way, and expressing\\nthe intense interest they felt. At length a murmur, like that of distant\\nthunder, ran through the crowd: a passage was, with some difficulty,\\neffected through the multitude by the officers in attendance, and the\\nwretched Veenah made her appearance, supported by her own father on one\\nside, and an uncle on the other--pale enough to be taken for an\\nEuropean--emaciated indeed, but still retaining the same exquisite beauty\\nof features and symmetry of form. She moved with the air of one who was\\nutterly indifferent to the concerns of this world, and to the awful fate\\nwhich awaited her. She turned her head on hearing the sound of my voice,\\nand, seeing me, shrieked out, \"He lives! he lives!\" but immediately\\nafterwards fainted in the arms of her supporters: at the same moment I\\nwas forcibly held back by some of the attendants, and a number of the\\nbystanders rushed in between us, and intercepted my view. I heard my\\nname now repeated in every direction by the multitude--some calling out\\nto the priests to desist, and others to proceed. I struggled to\\nextricate myself, and passion lent me momentary strength; but it was\\ninsufficient. After a short interval, I distinctly heard Veenah\\nimploring them to spare her. I called to the Brahmins who held her, to\\nleave her to herself. I endeavoured to rouse the multitude; but they\\ntook the precaution to drown our voices, by the musical instruments\\nwhich are used on these occasions. Four of these monsters I saw\\nprofaning the name of religion, by forcibly placing their victim on the\\npile, under the show of assisting her to mount it; and there held her\\ndown, beside the dead body of her husband, until, by cords provided for\\nthe purpose, she was prevented from rising. I besought--I threatened--I\\nraved;--but all thoughts and minds were engrossed by the premature fate\\nof one so young and beautiful, and I was unheeded.\\n\\n\"Among the relatives who pressed around the funeral pile, I saw Balty\\nMahu; and indignation for a moment got the better of grief. The pile was\\nnow lighted, and in a moment all was hidden in smoke. I sickened at the\\nsight, and was obliged to turn away. Even then I heard, or thought I\\nheard, the dying shrieks of the victim, amid the groans and cries, and\\nthe thousand shouts that rent the air! The pile and its contents being\\nnow enveloped in flame, my keepers set me free, when, by an impulse of\\nfrenzy, I rushed\\' to the pile, to make a last vain effort to rescue\\nVeenah, or to share her fate; but was stopped by some of the bystanders,\\nwho called my act a profanation.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes,\\' said Balty Mahu, \\'he has always been a scoffer of our religion.\\'\\nAs soon as these words reached my ears, with the quickness of thought I\\nsnatched a cimeter from the hands of one of the guards, and plunged it\\nin his breast. Of all that happened afterwards, my recollection is very\\nconfused. I was rudely seized, and hurried to prison. My father was\\ncoming to meet me, when he was informed of the fatal deed. I remember\\nthat my coolness, or rather stupor, was in strong contrast with the\\nviolence of his emotion. He accompanied me to prison, and continued with\\nme that night.\\n\\n\"It is not easy to take the life of one of my caste in India; and, by\\ndint of the exertions of my friends, in spite of the influence of Shunah\\nShoo, and the family of the Omrah, I was pardoned, on condition of doing\\npenance, which was, that I should never live in a country in which the\\nreligion of Brahmin prevailed, and should not again look at, or converse\\nwith, any woman for two minutes together. Ere this took place, my\\nexcellent mother, unable to withstand the shocks she had received from\\nmy supposed death, my misfortunes, and my crime, died a martyr to\\nmaternal affection. Wishing to conform to the sentence, and to be as\\nnear my father as I could, I removed to the kingdom of Ava, where, you\\nknow, they are followers of Buddha. Here I continued as long as my\\nfather lived, which was about six years. In this period, time had so\\nalleviated my grief, that I began to take pleasure in the cultivation of\\nscience, which constituted my chief employment.\\n\\n\"After my father\\'s death, I indulged a curiosity I had felt in my youth,\\nof seeing foreign countries; and I visited China, Japan, and England.\\nDuring my residence in Asia, I had discovered lunarium ore in the\\nmountain near Mogaun; and this circumstance, many years afterwards, when\\nI determined to rest from my labours, induced me to settle in that\\nmountain, as I have before stated. I have occasionally used the metal to\\ncounterbalance the gravity of a small car, by which I have profited, by\\na favourable wind, to indulge the melancholy satisfaction of looking\\ndown on the tombs of my parents, and of the ill-fated Veenah:\\napproaching the earth near enough, in the night, to see the sacred\\nspots, but not enough to violate the religious injunctions of my caste;\\nto avoid which, however, it was sometimes necessary for me to go across\\nHindostan to Arabia or Persia, and there wait for a change of wind\\nbefore I could return: and it was these excursions which suggested to\\nthe superstitious Burmans that my form had undergone a temporary\\ntransformation. When such have been the woes of my life, you can no\\nlonger think it strange, Atterley, that I delayed their painful recital;\\nor that, after having endured so much, all common dangers and\\nmisfortunes should appear to me insignificant.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe venerable Brahmin here concluded his narrative, and we both remained\\nthoughtful and silent for some time; he, apparently absorbed in the\\nrecollections of his eventful life; and I, partly in the reflections\\nawakened by his story, and partly in the intense interest of revisiting\\nmy native earth, and beholding once more all who were dear to me.\\nAlready the extended map beneath us was assuming a distinct and varied\\nappearance; and the Brahmin, having applied his eye to the telescope,\\nand made a brief calculation of our progress, considered that\\ntwenty-four hours more, if no accident interrupted us, would end our\\nvoyage; part of which interval I passed in making notes in my journal,\\nand in contemplating the different sections of our many-peopled globe,\\nas they presented themselves successively to the eye. It was my wish to\\nland on the American continent, and, if possible, in the United States.\\nBut the Brahmin put an end to that hope, by reminding me that we should\\nbe attracted towards the Equator, and that we had to choose between\\nAsia, Africa, and South America; and that our only course would be, to\\ncheck the progress of our car over the country of greatest extent,\\nthrough which the equinoctial circle might pass. Saying which, he\\nrelapsed into his melancholy silence, and I betook myself once more to\\nthe telescope. With a bosom throbbing with emotion, I saw that we were\\ndescending towards the American continent. When we were about ten or\\ntwelve miles from the earth, the Brahmin arrested the progress of the\\ncar, and we hovered over the broad Atlantic. Looking down on the ocean,\\nthe first object which presented itself to my eye, was a small\\none-masted shallop, which was buffeting the waves in a south-westerly\\ndirection. I presumed it was a New England trader, on a voyage to some\\npart of the Republic of Colombia: and, by way of diverting my friend\\nfrom his melancholy reverie, I told him some of the many stories which\\nare current respecting the enterprise and ingenuity of this portion of\\nmy countrymen, and above all, their adroitness at a bargain.\\n\\n\"Methinks,\" says the Brahmin, \"you are describing a native of Canton or\\nPekin. But,\" added he, after a short pause, \"though to a superficial\\nobserver man appears to put on very different characters, to a\\nphilosopher he is every where the same--for he is every where moulded by\\nthe circumstances in which he is placed. Thus; let him be in a situation\\nthat is propitious to commerce, and the habits of traffic produce in him\\nshrewdness and address. Trade is carried on chiefly in towns, because it\\nis there carried on most advantageously. This situation gives the trader\\na more intimate knowledge of his species--a more ready insight into\\ncharacter, and of the modes of operating on it. His chief purpose is to\\nbuy as cheap, and to sell as dear, as he can; and he is often able to\\nheighten the recommendations or soften the defects of some of the\\narticles in which he deals, without danger of immediate detection; or,\\nin other words, his representations have some influence with his\\ncustomers. He avails himself of this circumstance, and thus acquires the\\nhabit of lying; but, as he is studious to conceal it, he becomes wary,\\ningenious, and cunning. It is thus that the Phenicians, the\\nCarthagenians, the Dutch, the Chinese, the New-Englanders, and the\\nmodern Greeks, have always been regarded as inclined to petty frauds by\\ntheir less commercial neighbours.\" I mentioned the English nation.\\n\\n\"If the English,\" said he, interrupting me, \"who are the most commercial\\npeople of modern times, have not acquired the same character, it is\\nbecause they are as distinguished for other things as for traffic: they\\nare not merely a commercial people--they are also agricultural, warlike,\\nand literary; and thus the natural tendencies of commerce are mutually\\ncounteracted.\"\\n\\nWe afterwards descended slowly; the prospect beneath us becoming more\\nbeautiful than my humble pen can hope to describe, or will even attempt\\nto portray. In a short time after, we were in sight of Venezuela. We met\\nwith the trade-winds, and were carried by them forty or fifty miles\\ninland, where, with some difficulty, and even danger, we landed. The\\nBrahmin and myself remained together two days, and parted--he to explore\\nthe Andes, to obtain additional light on the subject of his hypothesis,\\nand I, on the wings of impatience, to visit once more my long-deserted\\nfamily and friends. But before our separation, I assisted my friend in\\nconcealing our aerial vessel, and received a promise from him to visit,\\nand perhaps spend with me the evening of his life. Of my journey home,\\nlittle remains to be said. From the citizens of Colombia, I experienced\\nkindness and attention, and means of conveyance to Caraccas; where,\\nembarking on board the brig Juno, captain Withers, I once more set foot\\nin New York, on the 18th of August, 1826, after an absence of four\\nyears, resolved, for the rest of my life, to travel only in books, and\\npersuaded, from experience, that the satisfaction which the wanderer\\ngains from actually beholding the wonders and curiosities of distant\\nclimes, is dearly bought by the sacrifice of all the comforts and\\ndelights of home.\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nAnonymous Review of _A Voyage to the Moon_\\n\\nReprinted from the American Quarterly Review No. 5 (March 1828), 61-88.\\n\\nART. III.--_A Voyage to the Moon: with some account of the Manners\\nand Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia and\\nother Lunarians_: By JOSEPH ATTERLEY. New-York: Elam Bliss, 1827.\\n12mo. pp. 264.\\n\\n\\nIt is somewhat remarkable, that perhaps the _only_ \"Voyages to\\nthe Moon,\" which have been published in the English tongue, should\\nhave been the productions of English bishops:--the first forming a\\ntract, re-published in the Harleian Miscellany, and said to have been\\nwritten by Dr. Francis Goodwin, Bishop of Landaff, (who died in 1633,)\\nand entitled \"_The Man in the Moon, or the discourse of a voyage\\nthither_, by Domingo Gonsales,\"--and the second written in 1638, by\\nDr. John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, under the title of \"_The\\nDiscovery of a New World, or a Discourse tending to prove, that \\'tis\\nprobable there may be another habitable world in the Moon, with a\\ndiscourse concerning the possibility of a passage thither.\"_ These\\ntwo works differ in several essential particulars:--in Dr. Goodwin\\'s,\\nwe have men of enormous stature and prodigious longevity, with a\\nflying chariot, and some other slight points of resemblance to the\\nTravels of Gulliver:--whilst Bishop Wilkins\\'s is intended honestly and\\nscientifically to prove, \"that it is possible for some of our\\nposterity to find out a conveyance to this other world; and, if there\\nbe inhabitants there, (which the Bishop, satisfactorily to himself,\\nsettles,) to have commerce with them!\" From the first of these, Swift\\nhas derived many hints in his voyage to Laputa, and improved them into\\nthose humorous and instructive allusions, which have caused the\\nreputation of the author of the _\"Travels of Gulliver\"_ to be\\nextended to every portion of the civilized globe. Since the appearance\\nof this celebrated satire, no one sufficiently comprehensive to lash\\nthe follies of the age--the _quicquid agunt homines_--has made\\nits appearance: we have had numerous ephemeral productions, inflicting\\nsevere castigations upon particular vices or absurdities; but the\\nvisionary conceits of the many, constantly promulgated in the\\nprogressive advancement of human knowledge, although legitimate\\nobjects of censure, have not, since the time of Swift, been embodied\\ninto one publication.\\n\\nThe evident aim of the author of the Satirical Romance before us, is\\nto fulfil for the present age, what _Swift_ so successfully\\naccomplished for that which has passed by:--to attack, by the weapons\\nof ridicule, those votaries of knowledge, who may have sought to avail\\nthemselves of the universal love of novelty amongst mankind, to acquire\\ncelebrity; or who may have been misled by their own ill-regulated\\nimaginations, to obtrude upon the world their crude and imperfect\\ntheories and systems, to the manifest retardation of knowledge:--an\\neffect, too, liable to be induced in a direct ratio with the degree\\nof talent and ingenuity by which their views may have been supported.\\nSeveral of these may always be more successfully attacked by ridicule\\nthan by reason; inasmuch as they are, in this way, more likely to become\\nthe subjects of popular animadversion; and many, who could withstand\\nthe serious arguments of their fraternity, cannot placidly endure their\\nridicule. Satire has, indeed, often done more service to the cause of\\nreligion and morality than a sermon, since the remedy is agreeable,\\nwhilst it at the same time communicates indignation or fear:--\\n\\n    \"Of all the ways that wisest men could find,\\n    To mend the age and mortify mankind,\\n    Satire, well writ, has most successful prov\\'d.\\n    And cures, because the remedy is lov\\'d.\"\\n\\nTo produce, however, the full effect, satire must possess a certain\\ndegree of impartiality, and be levelled in all instances at the vices\\nor follies, and not at the man. The first sketch of Gulliver\\'s Travels\\noccurs in the proposed Travels of Martinus Scriblerus, devised in that\\npleasing society where most of Swift\\'s miscellanies were planned. Had\\nthe work, however, been executed under the same auspices, it would\\nprobably, as Sir Walter Scott has suggested,[1] \"have been occupied by\\nthat personal satire, upon obscure and unworthy contemporaries, to\\nwhich Pope was but too much addicted. But when the Dean mused in\\nsolitude over the execution of his plan, it assumed at once a more\\ngrand and a darker complexion. The spirit of indignant hatred and\\ncontempt with which he regarded the mass of humanity; his quiet and\\npowerful perception of their failings, errors, and crimes; his zeal\\nfor liberty and freedom of thought, tended at once to generalize,\\nwhile it embittered, his satire, and to change traits of personal\\nseverity for that deep shade of censure which Gulliver\\'s Travels throw\\nupon mankind universally.\" Most of the sentiments which impressed\\nSwift, seem also to have been felt by the unknown author of the work\\nbefore us: it is not, however, free from personal allusions; but they\\nare all conveyed in so good natured a manner, as to satisfy the reader\\nthat the author has been solicitous to animadvert only on the vices of\\nthe individual; and in no part of the work is there the slightest\\nevidence of prejudice or venom.\\n\\nThe pseudo _Joseph Atterley_, the hero of the narrative, was born\\nin Huntingdon, Long-Island, on the 11th of May, 1786. He was the son\\nof a seafaring individual, who, by means of the portion he received by\\nhis wife, together with his own earnings, was enabled to quit that\\nlaborious occupation, and to enter into trade; and, after the death of\\nhis father-in-law, by whose will he received a handsome accession to\\nhis property, he sought, in the city of New-York, a theatre better\\nadapted to his enlarged capital. \"He here engaged in foreign trade,\\nand partaking of the prosperity which then attended American commerce,\\ngradually extended his business, and finally embarked in the then new\\nbranch of traffic to the East Indies and China; he was now generally\\nrespected both for his wealth and fair dealing; was several years a\\ndirector in one of the insurance offices; was president of the society\\nfor relieving the widows and orphans of distressed seamen; and, it is\\nsaid, might have been chosen alderman, if he had not refused, on the\\nground that he did not think himself qualified.\"\\n\\nOur hero was, at an early age, put to a grammar school of good repute,\\nin his native village, and, at seventeen, was sent to Princeton, to\\nprepare himself for some profession; during his third year at that\\nplace, in one of his excursions to Philadelphia, he became enamoured\\n\"with one of those faces and forms, which, in a youth of twenty, to\\nsee, admire, and love, is one and the same thing;\" and was united to\\nthe object of his affections, on the anniversary of his twenty-first\\nyear. This event gave him a distaste for serious study; and, long\\nbefore this, he had felt a sentiment, bordering on contempt, for\\nmercantile pursuits; he therefore prevailed upon his father to\\npurchase him a neat country seat in the vicinity of Huntingdon. Here,\\nseventeen happy years glided away swiftly and imperceptibly, when\\ndeath, by depriving him of the partner of his felicity, prostrated all\\nhis hopes and enjoyments. For the purpose of seeking for that relief\\nto the feelings, which variety can best afford, he now determined to\\nmake a voyage; and, as one of his father\\'s vessels was about to sail\\nfor Canton, embarked on board of her, and left Sandyhook on the 5th\\nday of June, 1822. From this period, until the 24th of October, their\\nvoyage was comparatively agreeable; but when off the mouths of the\\nGanges, one of those hurricanes, well known to the experienced\\nnavigators of the eastern seas, struck the ship, and rendered her so\\nleaky, that the captain considered it advisable to make for the\\nnearest port; the leak, however, increasing rapidly, and finding\\nthemselves off a coast, which the captain, by his charts, pronounced\\nto be a part of the Burman empire, and in the neighbourhood of Mergui,\\non the Martaban coast, they hastily threw their clothes, papers, and\\neight casks of silver, into the long-boat; and, before they were fifty\\nyards from the ship, had the melancholy satisfaction to see her go\\ndown.\\n\\n  \"It was a little after mid-day when we reached the town, which is\\n  perched on a high bluff, overlooking the coasts, and contains about a\\n  thousand houses, built of bamboo, and covered with palm leaves. Our\\n  dress, appearance, language, and the manner of our arrival, excited\\n  great surprise among the natives, and the liveliest curiosity; but\\n  with these sentiments some evidently mingled no very friendly\\n  feelings. The Burmese were then on the eve of a rupture with the East\\n  India Company, a fact which we had not before known; and mistaking us\\n  for English, they supposed, or affected to suppose, that we belonged\\n  to a fleet which was about to invade them, and that our ship had been\\n  sunk before their eyes, by the tutelar divinity of the country. We\\n  were immediately carried before their governor, or chief magistrate,\\n  who ordered our baggage to be searched, and finding that it consisted\\n  principally of silver, he had no doubt of our hostile intentions. He\\n  therefore sent all of us, twenty-two in number, to prison, separating,\\n  however, each one from the rest. My companions were released the\\n  following spring, as I have since learnt, by the invading army of\\n  Great Britain; but it was my ill fortune (if, indeed, after what has\\n  since happened, I can so regard it) to be taken for an officer of high\\n  rank, and to be sent, the third day afterwards, far into the interior,\\n  that I might be more safely kept, and either used as a hostage or\\n  offered for ransom, as circumstances should render advantageous.\"\\n\\nOur hero was transported very rapidly in a palanquin, for thirteen\\nsuccessive days, when he reached Mozaun, a small village delightfully\\nsituated in the mountainous district between the Irawaddi and Saloon\\nrivers, where he was placed under the care of an inferior magistrate,\\nwho there exercised the chief authority. By submissive and respectful\\nbehaviour, he succeeded in ingratiating himself so completely with his\\nkeeper, that he was regarded more as one of his family, than as a\\nprisoner; and was allowed every indulgence, consistently with his safe\\ncustody. It had been one of his favourite recreations, to ascend a\\npart of the western ridge of mountains, which rose in a cone, about a\\nmile and a half from the village, for the purpose of enjoying the\\nenchanting scenery that lay before him, and the evening breeze, which\\npossesses so delicious a degree of freshness in tropical climates.\\nHere he became acquainted with a personage, of whom, as he exerted an\\nimportant influence over the future conduct of our hero, it is of\\nconsequence that the reader should acquire early information:--\\n\\n  \"In a deep sequestered nook, formed by two spurs of this mountain,\\n  there lived a venerable Hindoo, whom the people of the village called\\n  the Holy Hermit. The favourable accounts I received of his character,\\n  as well as his odd course of life, made me very desirous of becoming\\n  acquainted with him; and, as he was often visited by the villagers, I\\n  found no difficulty in getting a conductor to his cell. His character\\n  for sanctity, together with a venerable beard, might have discouraged\\n  advances towards an acquaintance, if his lively piercing eye, a\\n  countenance expressive of great mildness and kindness of disposition,\\n  and his courteous manners, had not yet more strongly invited it. He\\n  was indeed not averse to society, though he had seemed thus to fly\\n  from it; and was so great a favourite with his neighbours, that his\\n  cell would have been thronged with visiters, but for the difficulty of\\n  the approach to it. As it was, it was seldom resorted to, except for\\n  the purpose of obtaining his opinion and counsel on all the serious\\n  concerns of his neighbours. He prescribed for the sick, and often\\n  provided the medicine they required--expounded the law--adjusted\\n  disputes--made all their little arithmetical calculations--gave them\\n  moral instruction--and, when he could not afford them relief in their\\n  difficulties, he taught them patience, and gave them consolation. He,\\n  in short, united, for the simple people by whom he was surrounded, the\\n  functions of lawyer, physician, schoolmaster, and divine, and richly\\n  merited the reverential respect in which they held him, as well as\\n  their little presents of eggs, fruit, and garden stuff.\\n\\n  \"From the first evening that I joined the party which I saw clambering\\n  up the path that led to the Hermit\\'s cell, I found myself strongly\\n  attached to this venerable man, and the more so, from the mystery\\n  which hung around his history. It was agreed that he was not a\\n  Burmese. None deemed to know certainly where he was born, or why he\\n  came thither. His own account was, that he had devoted himself to the\\n  service of God, and in his pilgrimage over the east, had selected this\\n  as a spot particularly favourable to the life of quiet and seclusion\\n  he wished to lead.\\n\\n  \"There was one part of his story to which I could scarcely give\\n  credit. It was said that in the twelve or fifteen years he had resided\\n  in this place, he had been occasionally invisible for months together,\\n  and no one could tell why he disappeared, or whither he had gone. At\\n  these times his cell was closed; and although none ventured to force\\n  their way into it, those who were the most prying could hear no sound\\n  indicating that he was within. Various were the conjectures formed on\\n  the subject. Some supposed that he withdrew from the sight of men for\\n  the purpose of more fervent prayer and more holy meditation; others,\\n  that he visited his home, or some other distant country. The more\\n  superstitious believed that he had, by a kind of metempsychosis, taken\\n  a new shape, which, by some magical or supernatural power, he could\\n  assume and put off at pleasure This opinion was perhaps the most\\n  prevalent, as it gained a colour with these simple people, from the\\n  chemical and astronomical instruments he possessed In these he\\n  evidently took great pleasure, and by then means he acquired some of\\n  the knowledge by which he so often excited their admiration.\\n\\n  \"He soon distinguished me from the rest of his visiters, by addressing\\n  questions to me relative to my history and adventures, and I, in turn,\\n  was gratified to have met with one who took an interest in my\\n  concerns, and who alone, of all I had here met with, could either\\n  enter into my feelings or comprehend my opinions. Our conversations\\n  were earned on in English, which he spoke with facility and\\n  correctness We soon found ourselves so much to each other\\'s taste,\\n  that there was seldom an evening that I did not make him a visit, and\\n  pass an hour or two in his company\\n\\n  \"I learned from him that he was born and bred at Benares, in\\n  Hindostan, that he had been intended for the priesthood, and had been\\n  well instructed in the literature of the east That a course of\\n  untoward circumstances, upon which he seemed unwilling to dwell, had\\n  changed his destination, and made him a wanderer on the face of the\\n  earth That in the neighbouring kingdom of Siam he had formed an\\n  intimacy with a learned French Jesuit, who had not only taught him his\\n  language, but imparted to him a knowledge of much of the science of\\n  Europe, its institutions and manners That after the death of this\\n  friend, he had renewed his wanderings, and having been detained in\\n  this village by a fit of sickness for some weeks, he was warned that\\n  it was time to quit his rambling life. This place being recommended to\\n  him, both by its quiet seclusion, and the unsophisticated manners of\\n  its inhabitants, he determined to pass the remnant of his days here,\\n  and, by devoting them to the purposes of piety, charity, and science,\\n  to discharge his duty to his Creator, his species, and himself, \\'for\\n  the love of knowledge,\\' he added, \\'has long been my chief source of\\n  selfish enjoyment\\'\"\\n\\nThe acquaintance between Atterley and the Brahmin, ripened by degrees,\\ninto that close friendship, which a congeniality of tastes and\\nsentiments, under proper opportunities, never fails to engender.\\nAtterley\\'s visits to the hermitage, became more and more frequent, for\\nupwards of three years, during which period, the Brahmin had\\noccasionally thrown out obscure hints, that the time would come, when\\nour hero should be restored to liberty, and that he had an important\\nsecret which he would one day communicate. About this period, one\\nafternoon in the month of March, when Atterley repaired, as usual, to\\nthe hermitage, he found the Brahmin dangerously ill of a pleuritic\\naffection, and apprehensive that the attack might prove fatal--\\n\\n  \"Sit down,\" said he, \"on that block, and listen to what I shall say to\\n  you Though I shall quit this state of being for another and a better,\\n  I confess that I was alarmed at the thought of expiring, before I had\\n  an opportunity of seeing and conversing with you I am the depository\\n  of a secret, that I believe is known to no other living mortal I once\\n  determined that it should die with me, and had I not met with you, it\\n  certainly should But from our first acquaintance, my heart has been\\n  strongly attracted towards you, and as soon as I found you possessed\\n  of qualities to inspire esteem as well as regard, I felt disposed to\\n  give you this proof of my confidence Still I hesitated I first wished\\n  to deliberate on the probable effects of my disclosure upon the\\n  condition of society I saw that it might produce evil, as well as\\n  good, but on weighing the two together, I have satisfied myself that\\n  the good will preponderate, and have determined to act accordingly\\n  Take this key, (stretching out his feverish hand,) and after waiting\\n  two hours, in which time the medicine I have taken will have either\\n  produced a good effect or put an end to my sufferings, you may then\\n  open that blue chest in the corner It has a false bottom On removing\\n  the paper which covers it, you will find the manuscript containing the\\n  important secret, together with some gold pieces, which I have saved\\n  for the day of need--because--(and he smiled in spite of his\\n  sufferings)--because hoarding is one of the pleasures of old men. Take\\n  them both, and use them discreetly.\"\\n\\nAtterley quitted the cell, and waited with feverish expectation for\\nthe termination of the allotted two hours, when, to his inexpressible\\ndelight, he found, on re-entering the cell, that not only did the\\nBrahmin breathe, but that he slept soundly; and, in the course of an\\nhour, he awoke, almost restored to health. This event, however, was\\nthe occasion of a more early disclosure of the Brahmin\\'s important\\nsecret, but not until he had recovered his ordinary health and\\nvigour:--\\n\\n  \"I have already told you, my dear Atterley, that I was born and\\n  educated at Benares, and that science is there more thoroughly\\n  understood and taught than the people of the west are aware of. We\\n  have, for many thousands of years, been good astronomers, chymists,\\n  mathematicians, and philosophers. We had discovered the secret of\\n  gunpowder, the magnetic attraction, the properties of electricity,\\n  long before they were heard of in Europe. We know more than we have\\n  revealed, and much of our knowledge is deposited in the archives of\\n  the castle to which I belong, but, for want of language generally\\n  understood and easily learnt, (for these records are always written in\\n  the Sanscrit, that is no longer a spoken language,) and the diffusion\\n  which is given by the art of printing, these secrets of science are\\n  communicated only to a few, and sometimes even sleep with their\\n  authors, until a subsequent discovery, under more favourable\\n  circumstances, brings them again to light.\\n\\n  \"It was at this seat of science that I learned, from one of our sages,\\n  the physical truth which I am now about to communicate, and which he\\n  discovered, partly by his researches into the writings of ancient\\n  Pundits, and partly by his own extraordinary sagacity. There is a\\n  principle of repulsion as well as gravitation in the earth. It causes\\n  fire to rise upwards. It is exhibited in electricity. It occasions\\n  water-spouts, volcanoes, and earthquakes. After much labour and\\n  research, this principle has been found embodied in a metallic\\n  substance, which is met with in the mountain in which we are, united\\n  with a very heavy earth, and this circumstance had great influence in\\n  inducing me to settle myself here.\\n\\n  \"This metal, when separated and purified, has as great a tendency to\\n  fly off from the earth, as a piece of gold or lead has to approach it.\\n  After making a number of curious experiments with it, we bethought\\n  ourselves of putting it to some use, and soon contrived, with the aid\\n  of it, to make cars and ascend into the air. We were very secret in\\n  these operations, for our unhappy country having then recently fallen\\n  under the subjection of the British nation, we apprehended that if we\\n  divulged our arcanum, they would not only fly away with all our\\n  treasures, whether found in palace or pagoda, but also carry off the\\n  inhabitants, to make them slaves in their colonies, as their\\n  government had not then abolished the African slave trade.\\n\\n  \"After various trials and many successive improvements, in which our\\n  desires increased with our success, we determined to penetrate the\\n  aerial void as far as we could, providing for that purpose an\\n  apparatus, with which you will become better acquainted hereafter. In\\n  the course of our experiments, we discovered that this same metal,\\n  which was repelled from the earth, was in the same degree attracted\\n  towards the moon, for in one of our excursions, still aiming to ascend\\n  higher than we had ever done before, we were actually carried to that\\n  satellite, and if we had not there fallen into a lake, and our machine\\n  had not been water-tight, we must have been dashed to pieces or\\n  drowned. You will find in this book,\" he added, presenting me with a\\n  small volume, bound in green parchment, and fastened with silver\\n  clasps, \"a minute detail of the apparatus to be provided, and the\\n  directions to be pursued in making this wonderful voyage. I have\\n  written it since I satisfied my mind that my fears of British rapacity\\n  were unfounded, and that I should do more good than harm by publishing\\n  the secret. But still I am not sure,\" he added, with one of his faint\\n  but significant smiles, \"that I am not actuated by a wish to\\n  immortalize my name; for where is the mortal who would be indifferent\\n  to this object, if he thought he could attain it? Read the book at\\n  your leisure, and study it.\"\\n\\nHere, by the way, we may remark, that the kind of vehicle best adapted\\nfor conveyance through the aerial void, has been a weighty stumbling\\nblock to authors, from the time of the eagle-mounted Ganymede, to that\\nof Daniel O\\'Rourke; or of the wing furnished Daedalus and Icarus, to\\nthat of the flying Turk in Constantinople, referred to by Busbequius;\\nor of the flying artist of the happy valley, in Rasselas. When\\nTrygaeus was desirous of reaching the Gods, he erected, we are told, a\\nseries of small ladders--[Greek: epeita lepta klimakia]--but receiving\\na severe contusion on the head, from their downfall, he ingeniously\\nhad recourse to a scheme of flying through the air, on a colossal\\nvariety of those industrious but not over-delicate insects, the\\n_Scarabaeus Carnifex_--the only insect, notwithstanding, according\\nto Aesop, privileged to ascend to the habitations of the gods--\\n\\n    [Greek: monos peteinoon eis theous aphigmenos.[2]]\\n\\nMost of the stories of Pegasi and Hippogriffs, and of flying chariots,\\nfrom that of Phaeton downwards to Astolfo\\'s,[3] were evidently\\nintended by their authors as mythical; not so, however, with Bishop\\nWilkins;--he boldly avers, for several reasons which he keeps to\\nhimself, and for others not very comprehensible to us, which he\\ndetails \"seriously and on good grounds,\" \"that it is possible to make\\na flying chariot, in which a man may sit, and give such a motion unto\\nit, as shall convey him through the air; and this perhaps might be\\nmade large enough to carry divers men at the same time, together with\\nfood for their _viaticum_, and commodities for traffic.\" \"It is\\nnot,\" lucidly continues the Bishop, \"the bigness of any thing in this\\nkind, that can hinder its motion, if the motive faculty be answerable\\nthereunto. We see a great ship swims as well as a small cork; and an\\neagle flies in the air, as well as a little gnat. This engine may be\\ncontrived from the same principles by which Archytas made a wooden\\ndove, and Regiomontanus a wooden eagle. I conceive it were no\\ndifficult matter, (if a man had leisure,) to show more particularly\\nthe means of composing it\"!--which want of leisure in the credulous\\nBishop, our readers will regret with us, especially those inventive\\ngeniuses, who, like the projector in the reign of George I., published\\na scheme for manufacturing pine plank from pine saw-dust, or the still\\nmore ingenious undertaker of later times, who proposed to make _pine\\nplank_ out of _oak_ saw-dust, by the mere addition of a little\\nturpentine!\\n\\nAgain, Swift\\'s flying Island of Laputa is a phenomenon so opposed to\\nall scientific probability, and so directly at variance with natural\\nlaws, that it loses in interest in a direct ratio with the violence it\\ndoes to our feelings. Nor is the mode of conveyance imagined by\\nVoltaire less incongruous than that of Swift. When Micromegas, ah\\ninhabitant of Sirius, whose adventures were evidently suggested by\\nthose of Gulliver, accompanied by an inhabitant of Saturn, leaves the\\nlatter planet, they are, in the first place, made to leap upon the\\nRing of Saturn, which they find tolerably flat, \"comme l\\'a fort bien\\ndevine un illustre habitant de notre petit globe:\" thence they go from\\nmoon to moon, and a comet passing close to one of these, they throw\\nthemselves upon it, with their attendants and instruments. In their\\ncourse, they fall in with the satellites of Jupiter, and pass on to\\nJupiter itself, where they remain for a year; but what becomes of the\\ncomet in the mean time, we are not informed! Leaving Jupiter, they\\n\"coast\" along the planet Mars, and finally reach the earth, where they\\nresolve to disembark. Accordingly \"ils passerent sur la queue de la\\ncomete; et trouvant une aurore boreale toute prete, ils se mirent\\ndedans, et arriverent a terre sur le bord septentrional de la Mer\\nBaltique\"![4]\\n\\nThe vehicle, however, has not formed the sole obstacle to those\\nprojectors:--the _viaticum_, especially the food, has been a\\ndifficulty not readily got over. Before Bishop Wilkins alludes to his\\nflying chariot, he remarks, that even if men could fly, the swiftest\\nof them would probably be half a year in reaching the end of his\\njourney; and hence a problem would arise, \"how it were possible to\\ntarry so long without sleep or diet?\" Of the former obstacle, however,\\nhe quickly disposes,--\"seeing we do not then spend ourselves in any\\nlabour, we shall not, it may be, _need_ the refreshment of sleep:\\nbut if we do, we cannot desire a softer bed than the air, where we may\\nrepose ourselves firmly and safely as in our chambers\"! Of the latter\\nhe finds somewhat more difficulty in disposing,--\"and here it is\\nconsiderable, that, since our bodies will then be devoid of gravity\\nand other impediments of motion, we shall not at all spend ourselves\\nin any labour, and so, consequently, not much need the reparation of\\ndiet, but may perhaps live altogether without it, as those creatures\\nhave done, who, by reason of their sleeping for many days together,\\nhave not spent any spirits, and so not wanted any food; which is\\ncommonly related of serpents, crocodiles, bears, cuckoos, swallows,\\nand such like. To this purpose, Mendoca reckons up divers strange\\nrelations, as that of Epimenides, who is storied to have slept\\nseventy-five years; and another of a rustic in Germany, who, being\\naccidentally covered with a hay-rick, slept there for all the autumn\\nand the winter following, without any nourishment Or, if we must needs\\nfeed upon something else, why may not smells nourish us? Plutarch, and\\nPliny, and divers other ancients, tell us of a nation in India, that\\nlived only upon pleasing odours; and it is the common opinion of\\nphysicians, that these do strangely both strengthen and repair the\\nspirits. Hence was it that Democritus was able, for divers days\\ntogether, to feed himself with the mere smell of hot bread.[5] Or, if\\nit be necessary that our stomachs must receive the food, why then it\\nis not impossible that the purity of the etherial air, being not mixed\\nwith any improper vapours, may be so agreeable to our bodies, as to\\nyield us sufficient nourishment,\" with many other arguments of the\\nlike nature. The Bishop ultimately, however, severs the knot, by the\\nsuggestion of his flying chariot, which he makes large enough (for,\\n_ce n\\'est que le premier pas qui coute!_) to carry not only food\\nfor the _viaticum_ of the passengers, but also commodities for\\ntheir traffic!\\n\\nInfinitely more ingenuity did the great comic poet of antiquity\\ndisplay, when he selected the _Scarabaeus;_ as the food which had\\nalready served the purposes of digestion with the Rider, was still\\ncapable of affording nutrition to the animal:--\\n\\n    [Greek:\\n    nun d\\'att\\'an autos kataphagoo ta sitia.\\n    toutoisi tois autoisi touton chortasoo[6]]\\n\\nNow all these schemes, ingenious as they may be, are objectionable for\\nthe same reasons as the flying Island of Laputa--their glaring\\nviolation of verisimilitude, and many of them of possibility. In these\\nrespects, that of the author of the work before us is liable to less\\nobjection: he only resorts to an extension of avowed physical\\nprinciples; and if we could suppose a substance, which, instead of\\ngravitating towards the earth, is repelled from it and attracted\\ntowards the moon, (certainly a difficult  \"_premier pas_,\") the\\nremainder of the machinery, for reaching that luminary, would not be\\ninconsistent with probability or the known laws of physics.\\n\\nBut, to return to the narrative:--The Brahmin having given Atterley a\\ndescription of some of the remarkable objects which he met with, in\\nhis voyage to the moon; expressed his anxiety to repeat it, for the\\npurpose of ascertaining some facts about which he had been\\nspeculating, as well as of removing the incredulity with which, he\\ncould not but perceive, his story had impressed his hearer,\\nnotwithstanding his belief in the Hermit\\'s integrity; when Atterley\\neagerly caught at the proposal. Their preparations, however, required\\ntime as well as considerable skill, not only for the construction of\\nthe vehicle, but also to avoid suspicion and interruption from the\\nGovernor of Mergui,--and the priesthood, who possessed the usual\\nOriental superstition and intolerance.\\n\\nFor the construction of their apparatus they had recourse to an\\ningenious artificer in copper and other metals, whose child the\\nBrahmin had been instrumental in curing of a chronic disease, and in\\nwhose fidelity as well as good will they could securely rely.\\n\\n  \"The coppersmith agreed to undertake the work we wanted done, for a\\n  moderate compensation, but we did not think it prudent to inform him\\n  of our object, which he supposed was to make some philosophical\\n  experiment. It was forthwith arranged that he should occasionally\\n  visit the Hermit, to receive instructions, as if for the purpose of\\n  asking medical advice. During this interval my mind was absorbed with\\n  our project; and when in company, I was so thoughtful and abstracted,\\n  that it has since seemed strange to me that Sing Fou\\'s suspicions that\\n  I was planning my escape were not more excited. At length, by dint of\\n  great exertion, in about three months every thing was in readiness,\\n  and we determined on the following night to set out on our perilous\\n  expedition.\\n\\n  \"The machine in which we proposed to embark, was a copper vessel, that\\n  would have been an exact cube of six feet, if the corners and edges\\n  had not been rounded off. It had an opening large enough to receive\\n  our bodies, which was closed by double sliding pannels, with quilted\\n  cloth between them. When these were properly adjusted, the machine was\\n  perfectly air-tight, and strong enough, by means of iron bars running\\n  alternately inside and out, to resist the pressure of the atmosphere,\\n  when the machine should be exhausted of its air, as we took the\\n  precaution to prove by the aid of an air pump. On the top of the\\n  copper chest and on the outside, we had as much of the lunar metal\\n  (which I shall henceforth call _lunarium_) as we found by\\n  calculation and experiment, would overcome the weight of the machine,\\n  as well as its contents, and take us to the moon on the third day. As\\n  the air which the machine contained, would not be sufficient for our\\n  respiration more than about six hours, and the chief part of the space\\n  we were to pass through was a mere void, we provided ourselves with a\\n  sufficient supply, by condensing it in a small globular vessel, made\\n  partly of iron and partly of lunarium, to take off its weight. On my\\n  return, I gave Mr. Jacob Perkins, who is now in England, a hint of\\n  this plan of condensation, and it has there obtained him great\\n  celebrity. This fact I should not have thought it worth while to\\n  mention, had he not taken the sole merit of the invention to himself,\\n  at least I cannot hear that in his numerous public notices he has ever\\n  mentioned my name.\\n\\n  \"But to return. A small circular window, made of a single piece of\\n  thick clear glass, was neatly fitted on each of the six sides. Several\\n  pieces of lead were securely fastened to screws which passed through\\n  the bottom of the machine as well as a thick plank. The screws were so\\n  contrived, that by turning them in one direction, the pieces of lead\\n  attached to them were immediately disengaged from the hooks with which\\n  they were connected. The pieces of lunarium were fastened in like\\n  manner to screws, which passed through the top of the machine; so that\\n  by turning them in one direction, those metallic pieces would fly into\\n  the air with the velocity of a rocket. The Brahmin took with him a\\n  thermometer, two telescopes, one of which projected through the top of\\n  the machine, and the other through the bottom; a phosphoric lamp, pen,\\n  ink, and paper, and some light refreshments sufficient to supply us\\n  for some days.\\n\\n  \"The moon was then in her third quarter, and near the zenith: it was,\\n  of course, a little after midnight, and when the coppersmith and his\\n  family were in their soundest sleep, that we entered the machine. In\\n  about an hour more we had the doors secured, and every thing arranged\\n  in its place, when, cutting the cords which fastened us to the ground,\\n  by means of small steel blades which worked in the ends of other\\n  screws, we rose from the earth with a whizzing sound, and a sensation\\n  at first of very rapid ascent, but after a short time, we were\\n  scarcely sensible of any motion in the machine, except when we changed\\n  our places.\"\\n\\nAfter the apprehensions of Atterley, occasioned by the novelty and\\ndanger of his situation, had partly subsided, he was enabled, with\\nmingled awe and admiration, to contemplate the magnificent spectacle\\nbeneath him. As the earth turned round its axis, during their ascent,\\nevery part of its surface came successively under view. At nine\\no\\'clock, the whole of India was to the west of them; its rivers\\nresembling small filaments of silver, and the Red Sea a narrow plate\\nof the same metal. The peninsula of India was of a dark, and Arabia of\\na light, grayer green, and the sun\\'s rays striking on the Atlantic,\\nemitted an effulgence dazzling to the eyes. On looking, some time\\nafterwards, through the telescope, they observed the African\\nContinent, at its northern edge; fringed, as it were, with green;\\n\"then a dull white belt marked the great Sahara or Desert, and then it\\nexhibited a deep green to its most southern extremity.\" The Morea and\\nGrecian Archipelago now fell under their telescope, and gradually the\\nwhole Mediterranean, and Arabian Gulf--the great media separating\\nAfrica from Europe and Asia; \"the political divisions of these\\nquarters of the world were of course undistinguishable, and few of the\\nnatural were discernible by the naked eye. The Alps were marked by a\\nwhite streak, though less bright than the water.\" By the aid of the\\nglass they could just discern the Danube, the Nile, and \"a river which\\nempties itself into the Gulf of Guinea,\" and which Atterley took to be\\nthe Niger; but the other streams were not perceptible. The most\\nconspicuous object of the solid part of the globe was the great\\nDesert; the whole of Africa, however, appeared of a brighter hue than\\neither Asia or Europe.\\n\\n  \"I was struck too, with the vast disproportion which the extent of the\\n  several countries of the earth bore to the part they had acted in\\n  history, and the influence they had exerted on human affairs. The\\n  British islands had diminished to a speck, and France was little\\n  larger, yet, a few years ago it seemed, at least to us in the United\\n  States, as if there were no other nations on the earth. The Brahmin,\\n  who was well read in European history, on my making a remark on this\\n  subject, reminded me that Athens and Sparta had once obtained almost\\n  equal celebrity, although they were so small as not now to be visible.\\n  As I slowly passed the telescope over the face of Europe, I pictured\\n  to myself the fat, plodding Hollander--the patient, contemplative\\n  German--the ingenious, sensual Italian--the temperate Swiss--the\\n  haughty, superstitious Spaniard--the sprightly, self-complacent\\n  Frenchman--the sullen and reflecting Englishman--who monopolise nearly\\n  all the science and literature of the earth, to which they bear so\\n  small a proportion. As the Atlantic fell under our view, two faint\\n  circles on each side of the equator, were to be perceived by the naked\\n  eye. They were less bright than the rest of the ocean. The Brahmin\\n  suggested that they might be currents; which brought to my memory Dr.\\n  Franklin\\'s conjecture on the subject, now completely verified by this\\n  circular line of vapour, as it had been previously rendered probable\\n  by the floating substances, which had been occasionally picked up, at\\n  great distances from the places where they had been thrown into the\\n  ocean. The circle was whiter and more distinct, where the Gulf Stream\\n  runs parallel to the American coast, and gradually grew fainter as it\\n  passed along the Banks of Newfoundland, to the coast of Europe, where,\\n  taking a southerly direction, the line of the circle was barely\\n  discernible. A similar circle of vapour, though less defined and\\n  complete, was perceived in the South Atlantic Ocean.\"\\n\\nBy degrees the travellers saw one half of the broad expanse of the\\nPacific, which glistened like quicksilver or polished steel, and\\nsubsequently the middle of the Pacific lay immediately beneath them;\\nthe irregular distribution of land and water on the globe, the expanse\\nof Ocean here, being twice as large as in any other part, gives\\noccasion to some amusing discussions on the various theories of\\ncosmogony, to which we can only refer the reader; wearied, however, by\\nthese and other discussions, Atterley slept for six hours, and on\\nawaking, found the Brahmin busy in calculating their progress; after\\nwhich the latter lay down and soon fell into a tranquil sleep, having\\npreviously requested that he might be awakened at the expiration of\\nthree hours, or sooner if any thing of moment should occur. Atterley\\nnow looked down again through the telescope, and found the earth\\nsurprisingly diminished in its apparent dimensions, from the increased\\nrapidity of their ascent; the eastern coasts of Asia were still full\\nin view, as well as the whole figure of that extensive continent--of\\nNew-Holland, of Ceylon and of Borneo; but the smaller islands were\\ninvisible.\\n\\n  \"I strained my eye to no purpose, to follow the indentations of the\\n  coast, according to the map before me, the great bays and promontories\\n  could alone be perceived. The Burman Empire, in one of the\\n  insignificant villages of which I had been confined for a few years,\\n  was now reduced to a speck. The agreeable hours I had passed with the\\n  Brahmin, with the little daughter of Sing Fou, and my rambling over\\n  the neighbouring heights, all recurred to my mind, and I almost\\n  regretted the pleasures I had relinquished. I tried with more success\\n  to beguile the time by making notes in my journal, and after having\\n  devoted about an hour to this object, I returned to the telescope, and\\n  now took occasion to examine the figure of the earth near the Poles,\\n  with a view of discovering whether its form favoured Captain Symmes\\'s\\n  theory of an aperture existing there, and I am convinced that that\\n  ingenious gentleman is mistaken. Time passed so heavily during these\\n  solitary occupations, that I looked at my watch every five minutes,\\n  and could scarcely be persuaded it was not out of order. I then took\\n  up my little Bible, (which had always been my travelling companion,)\\n  read a few chapters in St. Matthew, and found my feelings\\n  tranquillized, and my courage increased. The desired hour at length\\n  arrived; when, on waking the old man, he alertly raised himself up,\\n  and at the first view of the diminished appearance of the earth,\\n  observed that our journey was a third over, as to time, but not as to\\n  distance.\"\\n\\nAfter having again composed himself to rest for about four hours,\\nAtterley was awakened by the Brahmin, in whose arms he found himself,\\nand, on looking around, discovered that he was lying on what had been\\nthe ceiling of the chamber, which still, however, felt like the\\nbottom. The reason of this phenomenon was thus explained to him by the\\nBrahmin--\"we have, while you were asleep, passed the middle point\\nbetween the earth\\'s and the moon\\'s attraction; and we now gravitate\\nless towards our own planet than (to) her satellite. I took the\\nprecaution to move you, before you fell by your own gravity, from what\\nwas lately the bottom, to that which is now so, and to keep you in\\nthis place until you were retained in it by the moon\\'s attraction; for\\nthough your fall would have been, at this point, like that of a\\nfeather, yet it would have given you some shock and alarm. The\\nmachine, therefore, has undergone no change in its position or\\ncourse;--the change is altogether in our feelings.\"\\n\\nThe whole face of the moon, Atterley now found to be entirely changed,\\nand on looking through the upper telescope, the earth presented an\\nappearance not very dissimilar; but the outline of her continents and\\noceans was still perceptible in different shades, and capable of being\\nreadily recognised; the bright glare of the sun, however, made the\\nsurfaces of both bodies somewhat dim and pale.\\n\\n  \"After a short interval, I again looked at the moon, and found not\\n  only its magnitude very greatly increased, but that it was beginning\\n  to present a more beautiful spectacle. The sun\\'s rays fell obliquely\\n  on her disc, so that by a large part of its surface not reflecting the\\n  light, I saw every object on it, so far as I was enabled by the power\\n  of my telescope. Its mountains, lakes, seas, continents, and islands,\\n  were faintly, though not indistinctly, traced; and every moment\\n  brought forth something new to catch my eye, and awaken my curiosity.\\n  The whole face of the moon was of a silvery hue, relieved and varied\\n  by the softest and most delicate shades. No cloud nor speck of vapour\\n  intercepted my view. One of my exclamations of delight awakened the\\n  Brahmin, who quickly arose, and looking down on the resplendent orb\\n  below us, observed that we must soon begin to slacken the rapidity of\\n  our course, by throwing out ballast. The moon\\'s dimensions now rapidly\\n  increased; the separate mountains, which formed the ridges and chains\\n  on her surface, began to be plainly visible through the telescope;\\n  whilst, on the shaded side, several volcanoes appeared upon her disc,\\n  like the flashes of our fire-fly, or rather like the twinkling of\\n  stars in a frosty night. He remarked, that the extraordinary clearness\\n  and brightness of the objects on the moon\\'s surface, was owing to her\\n  having a less extensive and more transparent atmosphere than the\\n  earth: adding--\\'The difference is so great, that some of our\\n  astronomical observers have been induced to think she has none. If\\n  that, however, had been the case, our voyage would have been\\n  impracticable.\\'\"\\n\\nAfter gazing for some time on this magnificent spectacle, with\\nadmiration and delight, one of their balls of _lunarium_ was let\\noff for the purpose of checking their velocity. At this time the\\nBrahmin supposed they were not more than four thousand miles from the\\nnearest point of the moon\\'s surface. In about four hours more, her\\napparent magnitude was so great, that they could see her by looking\\nout of either of the side windows.\\n\\n  \"Her disc had now lost its former silvery appearance, and began to\\n  look more like that of the earth, when seen at the same distance. It\\n  was a most gratifying spectacle to behold the objects successively\\n  rising to our view, and steadily enlarging in their dimensions. The\\n  rapidity with which we approached the moon, impressed me, in spite of\\n  myself, with the alarming sensation of falling; and I found myself\\n  alternately agitated with a sense of this danger, and with impatience\\n  to take a nearer view of the new objects that greeted my eyes. The\\n  Brahmin was wholly absorbed in calculations for the purpose of\\n  adjusting our velocity to the distance we had to go, his estimates of\\n  which, however, were in a great measure conjectural; and ever and anon\\n  he would let off a ball of the lunar metal.\\n\\n  \"After a few hours, we were so near the moon that every object was\\n  seen in our glass, as distinctly as the shells or marine plants\\n  through a piece of shallow sea-water, though the eye could take in but\\n  a small part of her surface, and the horizon, which bounded our view,\\n  was rapidly contracting. On letting the air escape from our machine,\\n  it did not now rush out with the same violence as before, which showed\\n  that we were within the moon\\'s atmosphere. This, as well as ridding\\n  ourselves of the metal balls, aided in checking our progress. By and\\n  by we were within a few miles of the highest mountains, when we threw\\n  down so much of our ballast, that we soon appeared almost stationary.\\n  The Brahmin remarked, that he should avail himself of the currents of\\n  air we might meet with, to select a favourable place for landing,\\n  though we were necessarily attracted towards the same region, in\\n  consequence of the same half of the moon\\'s surface being always turned\\n  towards the earth.\"\\n\\nThe Brahmin now pointed out the necessity of looking out for some\\ncultivated field, in one of the valleys they were approaching, where\\nthey might rely on being not far distant from some human habitation,\\nand on escaping the perils necessarily attendant on a descent amongst\\nrocks, trees, and buildings. A gentle breeze now arising, as appeared\\nby their horizontal motion, which wafted them at the rate of about ten\\nmiles an hour, over a ridge of mountains, a lake, a thick wood, &c.\\nthey at length reached a cultivated region, which the Brahmin\\nrecognised as the country of the Morosofs, the place they were anxious\\nto visit. By now letting off two balls of lead to the _Earth_,\\nthey descended rapidly; and when they were sufficiently near the\\nground to observe that it was a fit place for landing, opened the door\\nof their Balloon, and found the air of the moon inconceivably sweet\\nand refreshing. They now let loose one of their lower balls, which\\nsomewhat retarded their descent; and in a few minutes more, being\\nwithin twenty yards of the ground, they let go the largest ball of\\nlunarium, which, having a cord attached to it, served in lieu of a\\ngrapnel; by this they drew themselves down, were disengaged from the\\nmachine in a twinkling, and landed \"safe and sound\" on, we presume,\\n\"_luna firma!_\"\\n\\nHaving seen our travellers securely deposited in the moon, we may\\nremark, that in the passage from the earth, various topics of an\\ninteresting and important character were canvassed by the Brahmin and\\nhis companion; one, _on the causes of national superiority_,\\nsuggested by the views of Africa, and a comparison between that\\nbenighted country and others more illuminated, is especially worthy of\\nattention, as containing a condensed and philosophical view of the\\nsubject; eloquently and perspicuously conveyed.\\n\\nThe view of America, suggests some remarks on the _political\\npeculiarities of the United States_, with speculations on their\\nfuture destiny.\\n\\nA lively description of the contrast between the circumstances of the\\nKamtschadale--\\n\\n    \"The shuddering tenant of the frigid zone,\"\\n\\nand the gay, voluptuous native of the Sandwich, and other isles within\\nthe tropics--the one passing his life in toil, privation, and care--the\\nother in ease, abundance, and enjoyment--leads to a similar conclusion\\nto that expressed by Goldsmith:--\\n\\n    \"And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,\\n    And estimate the blessings which they share,\\n    Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find\\n    An equal portion dealt to all mankind.\"\\n\\nA disquisition also takes place--_whether India or Egypt were the\\nparent of the Arts?_\\n\\nThis leads them to refer to the strange custom in the country of the\\nBrahmin, which impels the widow to throw herself on the funeral pile,\\nand be consumed with her husband:--\\n\\n  \"I told him,\" says Atterley, \"that it had often been represented as\\n  compulsory--or, in other words, that it was said that every art and\\n  means were resorted to, for the purpose of working on the mind of the\\n  woman, by her relatives, aided by the priests, who would be naturally\\n  gratified by such signal triumphs of religion over the strongest\\n  feelings of nature. He admitted that these engines were sometimes put\\n  in operation, and that they impelled to the sacrifice, some who were\\n  wavering; but insisted, that in a majority of instances, the\\n  _Suttee_ was voluntary.\\n\\n  \"\\'Women,\\' said he, \\'are brought up from their infancy, to regard our\\n  sex as their superiors, and to believe that their greatest merit\\n  consists in entire devotion to their husbands. Under this feeling, and\\n  having, at the same time, their attention frequently turned to the\\n  chance of such a calamity, they are better prepared to meet it when it\\n  occurs. How few of the officers in your western armies, ever hesitate\\n  to march, at the head of their men, on a forlorn hope? and how many\\n  even court the danger for the sake of the glory? Nay, you tell me\\n  that, according to your code of honour, if one man insults another, he\\n  who gives the provocation, and he who receives it, rather than be\\n  disgraced in the eyes of their countrymen, will go out, and quietly\\n  shoot at each other with fire-arms, till one of them is killed or\\n  wounded; and this too, in many cases, when the injury has been merely\\n  nominal. If you show such a contempt of death, in deference to a\\n  custom founded in mere caprice, can it be wondered that a woman should\\n  show it, in the first paroxysms of her grief for the loss of him to\\n  whom was devoted every thought, word, and action of her life, and who,\\n  next to her God, was the object of her idolatry? My dear Atterley,\\' he\\n  continued, with emotion, \\'you little know the strength of woman\\'s\\n  love!\\'\"\\n\\nOther topics of interest are also discussed with the like ingenuity.\\n\\nAfter this episode, it is time for us to return to our travellers,\\nwhose feelings, the moment they touched the ground, repayed them for\\nall they had endured. Atterley looked around with the most intense\\ncuriosity; but nothing he saw, \"surprised him so much, as to find so\\nlittle that was surprising:\"--vegetation, insects, and other animals,\\nwere pretty much of the same character as those he had before seen;\\nbut, on better acquaintance, he found the difference greater than he\\nhad at first supposed. Having refreshed themselves with the remains of\\ntheir stores, and secured the door of the machine, they bent their\\ncourse to the town of Alamatua, about three miles distant, which\\nseemed to contain about two thousand houses, and to be not quite as\\nlarge as Albany; the people were tall and thin, and of a pale,\\nyellowish complexion; their garments light, loose, and flowing, and\\nnot very different from those of the Turks; they subsist chiefly on a\\nvegetable diet, live about as long as we do on the earth,\\nnotwithstanding the great difference of climate, and other\\ncircumstances; and do not, in their manners, habits, or character,\\ndiffer more from the inhabitants of this globe, than some of the\\nlatter do from one another; their government, anciently monarchical,\\nis now popular; their code of laws very intricate; their language,\\nnaturally soft and musical, has been yet further refined by the\\ncultivation of letters; and they have a variety of sects in religion,\\npolitics, and philosophy.\\n\\nThe lunarians do not, as Butler has it--\\n\\n    \"When the sun shines hot at noon,\\n    Inhabit cellars under ground,\\n    Of eight miles deep and eighty round.\"\\n\\nBut, one half of their houses is beneath the surface, partly for the\\npurpose of screening them from the continued action of the sun\\'s rays,\\nand partly on account of the earthquakes caused by volcanoes. The\\nwindows of the houses consisted of openings in the wall, sloping so\\nmuch upwards, that, whilst they freely admitted the light and air, the\\nsun was completely excluded. As soon as they were espied by the\\nnatives, great curiosity was of course excited; not, however, to so\\ntroublesome an extent, as might have been, from the circumstance of\\nthe Brahmin\\'s having visited the moon before. Hence he was soon\\nrecognised by some of his acquaintances, and conducted to the house of\\nthe governor, by whom they were graciously received, and who \"began a\\ncourse of interesting inquiries regarding the affairs of the earth;\"\\nbut a gentleman, whom they afterwards understood to be one of the\\nleaders of the popular party, coming in, he soon despatched them;\\nhaving, however, first directed an officer to furnish them with all\\nthat was necessary for their accommodation, at the public expense;\\n\"which act of hospitality, they had reason to fear, occasioned him\\nsome trouble and perplexity at the succeeding election.\"\\n\\nA more minute description follows, of the dress of the male and female\\nlunarians, especially of that of the latter, to which we can merely\\nrefer the reader. There is one portion, however, of the inhabitants,\\nwith whom the reader must be made acquainted, inasmuch as they form\\nsome of the author\\'s most prominent characters. A large number of\\nlunarians, it seems, are born without any intellectual vigour, and\\nwander about like so many automatons, under the care of the\\ngovernment, until illumined by the mental ray, from some terrestrial\\nbrain, through the mysterious influence which the moon is known to\\nexercise on our planet. But, in this case, the inhabitant of the earth\\nloses what he of the moon gains, the ordinary portion of understanding\\nbeing divided between two; and, \"as might be expected, there is a most\\nexact conformity between the man of the earth, and his counterpart in\\nthe moon, in all their principles of action, and modes of thinking:\"--\\n\\n  \"These Glonglims, as they are called, after they have been thus imbued\\n  with intellect, are held in peculiar respect by the vulgar, and are\\n  thought to be in every way superior to those whose understandings are\\n  entire. The laws by which two objects, so far apart, operate on each\\n  other, have been, as yet, but imperfectly developed, and the wilder\\n  their freaks, the more they are the objects of wonder and admiration.\"\\n\\n\"Now and then, though very rarely, the man of the earth regains the\\nintellect he has lost; in which case, his lunar counterpart returns to\\nhis former state of imbecility. Both parties are entirely unconscious\\nof the change--one, of what he has lost, and the other, of what he has\\ngained.\"[7]\\n\\nThe belief of the influence of the moon on the human intellect, the\\nBrahmin remarks, may be perceived in the opinions of the vulgar, and\\nin many of the ordinary forms of expression; and he takes occasion to\\nremark, that these very opinions, as well as some obscure hints in the\\nSanscrit, give countenance to the idea, that they were not the only\\nvoyagers to the moon; but that, on the contrary, the voyage had been\\nperformed in remote antiquity; and the Lunarians, we are told, have a\\nsimilar tradition. Many ordinary forms of expression are adduced in\\nsupport of these ideas.\\n\\n\"Thus,\" says the Brahmin, \"it is generally believed, throughout all\\nAsia, that the moon has an influence on the brain: and when a man is\\nof insane mind, we call him a lunatic. One of the curses of the common\\npeople is, \\'May the moon eat up your brains!\\' and in China, they say\\nof a man who has done any act of egregious folly, \\'He was gathering\\nwool in the moon.\\'\" I was struck with these remarks; and told the\\nhermit that the language of Europe afforded the same indirect evidence\\nof the fact he mentioned,--that my own language, especially, abounded\\nwith expressions which could be explained on no other hypothesis: for,\\nbesides the terms \"lunacy,\" \"lunatic,\" and the supposed influence of\\nthe moon on the brain, when we see symptoms of a disordered intellect,\\nwe say the mind _wanders_, which evidently alludes to a part of\\nit rambling to a distant region, as is the moon. We say too, a man is\\n\"_out of his head_,\" that is, his mind being in another man\\'s\\nhead, must of course be out of his own. To \"know no more than the man\\nin the moon,\" is a proverbial expression for ignorance, and is without\\nmeaning, unless it be considered to refer to the Glonglims.[8]\\n\\n\"We say that an insane man is \\'distracted,\\' by which we mean that his\\nmind is drawn two different ways. So also, we call a lunatic _a man\\nbeside himself_, which most distinctly expresses the two distinct\\nbodies his mind now animates. There are, moreover, many other\\nanalogous expressions, as \\'moonstruck,\\' \\'deranged,\\' \\'extravagant,\\' and\\nsome others, which, altogether, form a mass of concurring testimony\\nthat it is impossible to resist.\"\\n\\nLeaving this ingenious _badinage_ with the defence of the serious\\nand sentimental Schiller,\\n\\n    \"Hoher Sinn liegt oft in Kindischen Spiele,\"\\n\\nwe return to our travellers, who, at their lodgings, meet with an\\ninstance of _lunar puritanism_--the family eating those portions\\nof fruits, vegetables, &c., which are thrown away by us, and _vice\\nversa_, \"from a persuasion that all pleasure received through the\\nsenses is sinful, and that man never appears so acceptable in the sight\\nof the Deity, as when he rejects all the delicacies of the palate, as\\nwell as other sensual gratifications, and imposes on himself that food\\nto which he feels naturally most repugnant.\"\\n\\n_Avarice_ is satirized by the story of one of these Glonglims, who\\nis occupied in making nails, and then dropping them into a well--refusing\\nto exchange them for bread or clothes, notwithstanding his starved,\\nhaggard appearance, and evident desire for the food proffered:--\\n\\n    \"Mettant toute sa gloire et son souverain bien\\n    A grossir un tresor qui ne lui sert de rien.\"\\n\\nAnd this is followed by a picture of _reckless prodigality_ in\\nanother Glonglim.\\n\\nWe pass over the description of the physical peculiarities of the\\nmoon, which seem to be according to the received opinions of\\nastronomers, as well as the satire on _National Prejudices_, in\\nthe persons of the Hilliboos and Moriboos, and that on the Godwinian\\nsystem of morals.\\n\\nAn indisposition experienced by Atterley, occasions his introduction\\nto Vindar,[9] a celebrated physician, botanist, &c., on whose opinions\\nwe have a keen satire.\\n\\nOn leaving Vindar\\'s house, they observed a short man, (Napoleon,)\\npreparing to climb to the top of a plane tree, on which there was one\\nof the tail feathers of a flamingo; and this he would only mount in\\none way--on the shoulders of his men:--\\n\\n  \"I could not see this rash Glonglim attempt to climb that dangerous\\n  ladder, without feeling alarm for his safety. At first all seemed to\\n  go on very well; but just as he was about to lay hold of the gaudy\\n  prize, there arose a sudden squall, which threw both him and his\\n  supporters into confusion, and the whole living pyramid came to the\\n  ground together. Many were killed--some were wounded and bruised.\\n  Polenap himself, by lighting on his men, who served him as cushions,\\n  barely escaped with life. But he received a fracture in the upper part\\n  of his head, and a dislocation of the hip, which will not only prevent\\n  him from ever climbing again, but probably make him a cripple for\\n  life.\\n\\n  \"The Brahmin and I endeavoured to give the sufferers some assistance;\\n  but this was rendered unnecessary, by the crowd which their cries and\\n  lamentations brought to their relief. I thought that the author of so\\n  much mischief would have been stoned on the spot; but, to my surprise,\\n  his servants seemed to feel as much for his honour as their own\\n  safety, and warmly interfered in his behalf, until they had somewhat\\n  appeased the rage of the surrounding multitude.\"\\n\\nThe _absurdities_ of the _physiognomical system_ of Lavater,\\nand of the _craniological system_ of MM. Gall and Spurzheim, were\\nnot likely to escape animadversion, in a work of general satire,\\nfruitful as they have already been in such themes. The representative\\nof the former, is a fortune-telling philosopher, Avarabet, (Lavater,)\\nwhose course of proceeding was, to examine the finger nails, and,\\naccording to their form, colour, thickness, surface, grain, and other\\nproperties, to determine the character and destinies of those who\\nconsulted him; and that of the latter, a physician, who judged of the\\ncharacter of disposition or disease, by the examination of a lock of\\nthe hair. The upshot of the story is, as might be anticipated, that\\nthe fortune-telling philosopher is caught, and exposed in his own\\ntoils.\\n\\nThe _impolicy of privateers, and of letters of marque and\\nreprisals_, is next animadverted on, by the story of two\\nneighbours, who are at variance, and whose dependants are occupied in\\nlaying hold of what they can of each other\\'s flocks and herds, and\\ndoing as much mischief as possible, by which both parties, of\\nnecessity, suffer.\\n\\nA visit to a projector in building, husbandry, and cookery, introduces\\nus to some inventions not unworthy of the occupation, of the courtiers\\nof _La Reine Quinte_, or of the Professors of the Academy of\\nLagado.\\n\\nThe doctrine of the aerial formation of meteoric stones, receives,\\ntoo, a passing notice from our author, who is clearly no supporter of\\nit. It was a long time before the ancients received credit for their\\nstories of showers of stones; and all were ready to joke with Butler,\\nat the story of the Thracian rock, which fell in the river Aegos:--\\n\\n    \"For Anaxagoras, long agon,\\n    Saw hills, as well as you i\\'th\\' moon,\\n    And held the sun was but a piece\\n    Of red hot iron as big as Greece.\\n    Believ\\'d the heavens were made of stone,\\n    Because the sun had voided one:\\n    And, rather than he would recant\\n    Th\\' opinion, suffered banishment.\"\\n\\nA difficulty surrounds the subject, however we view it.\\n_Aerolites_, as they have been designated, have now been found in\\nalmost every region and climate of the globe--from Arabia to the\\nfarthest point of Baffin\\'s Bay; and this very circumstance would seem\\nto be opposed to their aerial origin, unless we are to suppose that\\nthey can be formed in every state, and in the opposite extremes of the\\natmosphere. The Brahmin assigns them a lunar origin, and adds, \"our\\nparty were greatly amused at the disputations of a learned society in\\nEurope, in which they undertook to give a mathematical demonstration,\\nthat they could not be thrown from a volcano of the earth, nor from\\nthe moon, but were suddenly formed in the atmosphere. I should as soon\\nbelieve, that a loaf of bread could be made and baked in the\\natmosphere.\"\\n\\nThe \"gentleman farmer and projector,\" being attacked, during their\\nvisit, with cholera morbus, and considering himself _in extremis_,\\na consultation of physicians takes place, in which one portrait\\nwill be obvious--that of Dr. Shuro, who asserts disease to be\\na unit; and that it is the extreme of folly, to divide diseases into\\nclasses, which tend but to produce confusion of ideas, and an\\nunscientific practice. The enthusiasm of the justly celebrated\\nindividual--the original of this portrait, was so great, that the\\nslightest data were sufficient for the formation of some of his most\\nelaborate _hypotheses_--for _theories_ they could not properly\\nbe called; and, accordingly, many of his beautiful and ingenious\\nsuperstructures are now prostrated, leaving, in open day, the\\ninsufficiency of their foundation. One of the most striking\\nexamples of this nature, was his belief that the black colour of\\nthe negro is a disease, which depletion, properly exercised, might\\nbe capable of remedying--a scheme not a whit more feasible, than\\nthat of the courtiers of _La Reine Quinte_, referred to by\\nRabelais, \"who made blackamoors white, as fast as hops, by just\\nrubbing their stomachs with the bottom of a pannier.\"\\n\\nThe satire here is not so fortunately displayed, as in other\\ninstances, owing probably to the difficulty of saying any thing new on\\nso hackneyed a subject; for it has ever happened, that,--\\n\\n    \"The Galenist and Paracelsian,\\n    Condemn the way each other deals in.\"\\n\\nThe affair concludes, by the Doctors quarrelling; and, in the mean\\ntime, the patient, profiting by some simple remedies administered by\\nthe Brahmin, and an hour\\'s rest, was so much refreshed, that he\\nconsidered himself out of danger, and had no need of medical\\nassistance.\\n\\n_Pestolozzi\\'s system of education_, is with justice satirized;\\nsince, instead of affording facilities to the student, as the\\nsuperficial observer might fancy, it retards his acquisition of\\nknowledge, by teaching him to exercise his external senses, rather\\nthan his reflection.[10]\\n\\nIn a _menagerie_ attached to an academy, in which youths of\\nmaturer years were instructed in the fine arts, the travellers had an\\nopportunity of observing the vain attempts of education, to control\\nthe natural or instinctive propensities.\\n\\n    \"Naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret.\"\\n\\n    \"For nature driven out, with proud disdain,\\n    All powerful goddess, will return again.\"\\n\\nThe election of a town constable, exhibits the violence of _Lunar\\nPolitics_ to be much the same as the terrestrial, and seems to have\\nsome allusion to an existing and important controversy amongst\\nourselves. The _prostitution of the press_ is satirized by the\\nstory of a number of boys dressed in black and white--wearing the\\nbadges of the party to which they respectively belong, and each\\nprovided with a syringe and two canteens, the one filled with rose\\nwater, and the other with a black, offensive, fluid: the rose water\\nbeing squirted at the favourite candidates and voters--the other fluid\\non the opposite party. All these were under regular discipline, and at\\nthe word of command discharged their syringes on friend or foe, as the\\ncase might be.\\n\\nThe \"_glorious uncertainty of the law_\" (proverbial with us,)\\nfalls also under notice. In Morosofia, it seems, a favourite mode of\\nsettling private disputes, whether concerning person, character, or\\nproperty, is by the employment of prize fighters who hire themselves\\nto the litigants:--\\n\\n    \"And out of foreign controversies\\n    By aiding both sides, fill their purses:\\n    But have no int\\'rest in the cause\\n    For which th\\' engage and wage the laws\\n    Nor farther prospect than their pay\\n    Whether they lose or win the day.\"\\n\\nThe chapter concludes with a discussion between an old man and his\\nwife, in which the _policy of encouraging manufactures_, is\\nargued.\\n\\nIn an account of Okalbia--a happy valley--similar only in name to that\\nin _Rasselas_, the author seems to sketch his views of a _perfect\\ncommonwealth_, and glances at some important questions of\\n_politics_ and _political economy_. Prudential restraints are\\nconsidered sufficient to obviate a _redundancy of population_--and\\non _Ricardo\\'s theory of rent_, the author holds the same opinions\\nas those already expressed in this Journal.\\n\\nSome useful hints are also afforded on the subject of _legislation\\nand jurisprudence_.\\n\\nAfter having passed a week amongst the singular and happy Okalbians,\\nwhom our travellers found equally amiable, intelligent, and\\nhospitable, they returned to Alamatua.\\n\\nJeffery\\'s _theory of beauty_, as developed in the article\\n_beauty_, of the _supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica_,\\nin which he denies the existence of original beauty and refers\\nit to association, is ridiculed by an extension of a similar kind\\nof reasoning to the smell.\\n\\nA description of a _Lunar fair_ follows, which, like a\\nterrestrial, is the resort of the busy, the idle, the knavish, and the\\ngay: some in pursuit of pleasure; others again, without any settled\\npurpose, carried along by the vague desire of meeting with something\\nto relieve them from the pain of idleness. _Political contests_\\nare here represented under the character of gambling transactions, and\\nif we mistake not, there is a distinct allusion to more than one\\nimportant contest in the annals of this country.\\n\\nHaving now satisfied his curiosity, Atterley became anxious to return\\nto his native planet, and accordingly urged the Brahmin to lose no\\ntime in preparing for their departure. They were soon, however,\\ninformed that a man high in office, by way of affecting political\\nsagacity, had proposed to detain them, on the ground that when such\\nvoyages as their\\'s were shown to be practicable, the inhabitants of\\nthe earth, who were so much more numerous than those of the moon,\\nmight invade the latter with a large army, for the purpose of rapine\\nand contest; but notwithstanding the influence of this sapient\\npolitician, they finally obtained leave to quit the moon whenever they\\nthought proper.\\n\\nHaving taken a \"respectful or affectionate\" leave of all their\\nlunarian friends, and got every thing in readiness,--at midnight of\\nthe twentieth of August, they again entered their copper\\n_balloon_, and after they had ascended until the face of the moon\\nlooked like one vast lake of melted silver, with here and there small\\npieces of grayish dross floating on it, Atterley reminded the Brahmin\\nof a former promise to detail the history of his early life, to which\\nhe assented:--of this, perhaps the most interesting part of the book,\\nto the general reader, we regret that our limits will only admit of\\nour giving a very condensed and imperfect narrative.\\n\\nGurameer, the Brahmin, was born at Benares. He was the only son of a\\npriest of Vishnu, of rank, and was himself intended for the\\npriesthood. At school, he meets with a boy of the name of _Balty\\nMahu_, between whom and himself a degree of rivalry, and\\nsubsequently the most decided enmity, existed--a circumstance that\\ndecided the character of Gurameer\\'s subsequent life. They afterwards\\nmet at college, where a more extended theatre was afforded for the\\nexercise of Balty Mahu\\'s malignity. During a vacation, Gurameer, being\\non a visit to an uncle in the country, one day, when the family had\\ngone to witness a grand spectacle in honour of an important festival\\nin their calendar, which he could not himself attend consistently with\\nthe rules of his caste, was tempted to visit the deserted Zenana, or\\nladies\\' apartment, where he accidentally meets with a beautiful young\\nfemale. The acquaintance, thus begun, soon ripened into intimacy, by\\nmeans of walks in the garden, contrived by Fatima, one of his female\\ncousins. At length they are constrained to separate. Veenah (for so\\nthe young lady is named) returns to Benares, whither Gurameer soon\\nfollows her. On making his father acquainted with his attachment, the\\nlatter endeavours to persuade him to overcome it, and informs him that\\nVeenah\\'s father is avaricious, and a bigot, and hence, that he would\\nprobably be prejudiced against him, owing to some imputations which\\nhad been cast on Gurameer\\'s religious creed, and industriously\\ncirculated by his old enemy, Balty Mahu, who proves to be the cousin\\nof Veenah These considerations prevail upon Gurameer to defer any\\napplication to Veenah\\'s father, until the suspicions regarding his\\nfaith had either died away or been falsified by his scrupulous\\nobservance of all religious duties. This resolution he determines to\\ncommunicate to his mistress. Accordingly, in the evening, he betakes\\nhimself to the quarter of the city where Veenah\\'s father lives; and,\\nwalking to and fro before the house, soon discovers that he is\\nrecognised. By a cord, let down from the window, he conveys a letter\\nto her, which, the following evening, she answers; and thus a regular\\ncorrespondence was kept up, which, by the exercise it afforded to\\ntheir imaginations, and the difficulties attendant upon it, inflamed\\ntheir passion to the highest pitch. He had, however, soon the\\nmisfortune to be discovered by Balty Mahu, and, in consequence, Veenah\\nis debarred from pen and ink, but contrives to acquaint her lover that\\ntheir intercourse has been discovered, by a short note, written with a\\nburnt stick. Gurameer now goes in despair to Veenah\\'s father, from\\nwhom he experiences a haughty repulse, and who, in the following\\nnight, secretly leaves the city, with his daughter, embarking on the\\nGanges, and taking measures to prevent the discovery of the place of\\nhis retreat. At the expiration of two or three months, an end is put\\nto Gurameer\\'s doubts and apprehensions, by his return, with his\\ndaughter and son-in-law--a rich Omrah, four times her age. After the\\nfirst ebullitions of rage have subsided, his love returns; but he is\\nnever able to succeed in obtaining an interview with Veenah. By his\\ncousin Fatima, he learns the circumstances of Veenah\\'s marriage, and\\nthe deceptions which had been practised on her, aided by the unbounded\\nauthority which parents exercise in eastern countries. The unhappy\\nVeenah, as firm in her principles as she was gentle in disposition,\\nrefuses to see him. \"Tell him,\" said she, \"that Heaven has forbidden\\nit, and to its decrees we are bound to submit I am now the wife of\\nanother, and it is our duty to forget all that is past. But if this be\\npossible, my heart tells me it can be only by our never meeting!\"\\n\\nGurameer now fell into a state of settled melancholy, and consented to\\ntravel, more for the purpose of pleasing his parents, than from any\\nconcern for his own health; but travelling had little effect--\"he\\ncarried a barbed arrow in his heart; and the greater the efforts to\\nextract it, the more they rankled the wound.\" When so much emaciated\\nthat he was not expected to live a month, he took a voyage, coastwise,\\nto Madras; and, on his arrival there, learned that Balty Mahu had\\nrecently left that place. This intelligence operated like a charm; the\\ndesire of revenge roused all his energies and became his master\\npassion. He immediately set off in pursuit; but, although often near,\\ncould never overtake him. His health rapidly improves; and at length\\nhe hears that the old Omrah\\'s health is rapidly declining. This\\ninformation awakens new thoughts and hopes, and Balty Mahu is\\nforgotten. He hastens hack to Benares; and when near the city, hears\\ntwo merchants, in conversation, remark that the Omrah is dead, and\\nthat his widow was the next day to perform the _Suttee_. He\\nimmediately mounts his horse, and reaches the city the next morning at\\nsunrise. In the street he mixes with the throng;--hears Veenah pitied,\\nher father blamed, and himself lamented. He now sees Veenah approach\\nthe funeral pile, who, at the well known sound of his voice, shrieked\\nout, \"he lives! he lives!\" and would have attempted to save herself\\nfrom the flames; but the shouts of the surrounding multitude, and the\\nsound of the instruments, drowned her voice. He now attempts to\\napproach the pile for the purpose of rescuing her, but is forcibly\\nheld back until the wretched Veenah is enveloped in flames. On his\\nagain attempting to reach the pile, he was charged with profanation;\\nand, on Balty Mahu\\'s making his appearance and encouraging the charge,\\nin frantic desperation he seizes a scymetar from one of the guards,\\nand plunges it in his breast. The influence of his friends, and the\\nsacred character of persons of his caste, saved the Brahmin from\\ncapital punishment; but he was banished from Hindostan. He now removed\\nto the kingdom of Ava, where he continued so long as his parents\\nlived, after which he visited several countries, both of Asia and\\nEurope; and in one of his journeys, having discovered Lunarium Ore in\\nthe mountain near Mogaun, he determined to pass the remainder of his\\ndays in that secluded retreat.--\"So ends this strange, eventful\\nhistory.\"\\n\\nWhen the Brahmin terminated his narrative, the extended map beneath\\nthem was already assuming a distinct and varied appearance:--\\n\\n  \"The Brahmin, having applied his eye to the telescope, and made a\\n  brief calculation of our progress, considered that twenty-four hours\\n  more, if no accident interrupted us, would end our voyage; part of\\n  which interval I passed in making notes in my journal, and in\\n  contemplating the different sections of our many peopled globe, as\\n  they presented themselves successively to the eye. It was my wish to\\n  land on the American continent, and, if possible, in the United\\n  States. But the Brahmin put an end to that hope, by reminding me that\\n  we should be attracted towards the Equator, and that we had to choose\\n  between Asia, Africa, and South America; and that our only course\\n  would be, to check the progress of our car over the country of\\n  greatest extent, through which the equinoctial circle might pass.\\n  Saying which, he relapsed into his melancholy silence, and I betook\\n  myself once more to the telescope. With a bosom throbbing with\\n  emotion, I saw that we were descending towards the American continent.\\n  When we were about ten or twelve miles from the earth, the Brahmin\\n  arrested the progress of the car, and we hovered over the broad\\n  Atlantic. Looking down on the ocean, the first object which presented\\n  itself to my eye, was a small one-masted shallop, which was buffetting\\n  the waves in a south-westerly direction. I presumed it was a\\n  New-England trader, on a voyage to some part of the Republic of\\n  Colombia: and, by way of diverting my friend from his melancholy\\n  reverie, I told him some of the many stories which are current\\n  respecting the enterprise and ingenuity of this portion of my\\n  countrymen, and above all, their adroitness at a bargain.\\n\\n  \"\\'Methinks,\\' says the Brahmin, \\'you are describing a native of Canton\\n  or Pekin. But,\\' added he, after a short pause, \\'though to a\\n  superficial observer man appears to put on very different characters,\\n  to a philosopher he is every where the same--for he is every where\\n  moulded by the circumstances in which he is placed. Thus; let him be\\n  in a situation that is propitious to commerce, and the habits of\\n  traffic produce in him shrewdness and address. Trade is carried on\\n  chiefly in towns, because it is there carried on most advantageously.\\n  This situation gives the trader a more intimate knowledge of his\\n  species--a more ready insight into character, and of the modes of\\n  operating on it. His chief purpose is to buy as cheap, and to sell as\\n  dear, as he can; and he is often able to heighten the recommendations\\n  or soften the defects of some of the articles in which he deals,\\n  without danger of immediate detection; or, in other words, big\\n  representations have some influence with his customers. He avails\\n  himself of this circumstance, and thus acquires the habit of lying;\\n  but, as he is studious to conceal it, he becomes wary, ingenious, and\\n  cunning. It is thus that the Phenicians, the Carthagenians, the Dutch,\\n  the Chinese, the New-Englanders, and the modern Greeks, have always\\n  been regarded as inclined to petty frauds by their less commercial\\n  neighbours.\\' I mentioned the English nation.\\n\\n  \"\\'If the English,\\' said he, interrupting me; \\'who are the most\\n  commercial people of modern times, have not acquired the same\\n  character, it is because they are as distinguished for other things as\\n  for traffic: they are not merely a commercial people--they are also\\n  agricultural, warlike, and literary; and thus the natural tendencies\\n  of commerce are mutually counteracted.\\'\\n\\n  \"We afterwards descended slowly; the prospect beneath us becoming more\\n  beautiful than my humble pen can hope to describe, or will even\\n  attempt to portray. In a short time after, we were in sight of\\n  Venezuela. We met with the trade winds and were carried by them forty\\n  or fifty miles inland, where, with some difficulty, and even danger,\\n  we landed. The Brahmin and myself remained together two days, and\\n  parted--he to explore the Andes, to obtain additional light on the\\n  subject of his hypothesis, and I, on the wings of impatience, to visit\\n  once more my long-deserted family and friends. But before our\\n  separation, I assisted my friend in concealing our aerial vessel, and\\n  received a promise from him to visit, and perhaps spend with me the\\n  evening of his life. Of my journey home, little remains to be said.\\n  From the citizens of Colombia, I experienced kindness and attention,\\n  and means of conveyance to Caraccas; where, embarking on board the\\n  brig Juno, captain Withers, I once more set foot in New-York, on the\\n  18th of August, 1826, after an absence of four years, resolved, for\\n  the rest of my life, to travel only in books, and persuaded, from\\n  experience, that the satisfaction which the wanderer gains from\\n  actually beholding the wonders and curiosities of distant climes, is\\n  dearly bought by the sacrifice of all the comforts and delights of\\n  home.\"\\n\\nWe have thus placed before the reader an analysis of this interesting\\nSatirical Romance. The time and space we have occupied sufficiently\\nindicate the favourable sentiments respecting it with which we have\\nbeen impressed. Of the execution of the satires, from the several\\nextracts we have given, the reader will himself be enabled to judge.\\nThis is of course unequal, but generally felicitous. In the personal\\nallusions which occur through the work, the author exhibits, as we\\nhave before noticed, a freedom from malice and all uncharitableness,\\nand in many of them has attained that happy _desideratum_ which\\nDryden considered a matter of so much difficulty:--\\n\\n  \"How easy is it,\" he observes, \"to call rogue and villain, and that\\n  wittily! But how hard to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a\\n  knave, without using any of those opprobrious terms! To spare the\\n  grossness of the names, and to do the thing yet more severely, is to\\n  draw a full face, and to make the nose and cheeks stand out, and yet\\n  not to employ any depth of shadowing. This is the mystery of that\\n  noble trade, which yet no master can teach to his apprentice; he may\\n  give the rules, but the scholar is never the nearer in his practice;\\n  neither is it true, that this fineness of raillery is offensive. A\\n  witty man is tickled, while he is hurt, in this manner, and a fool\\n  feels it not: the occasion of an offence may possibly be given, but he\\n  cannot take it. If it be granted, that, in effect, this way does more\\n  mischief--that a man is secretly wounded, and, though he be not\\n  sensible himself, yet the malicious world will find it out for him,\\n  yet, there is still a vast difference betwixt the slovenly butchering\\n  of a man, and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from\\n  the body, and leaves it standing in its place. A man may be capable,\\n  as Jack Ketch\\'s wife said of his servant, of a plain piece of work, a\\n  bare hanging; but to make a malefactor die sweetly, was only belonging\\n  to her husband.\"[11]\\n\\nIn conclusion, we must express our regret, that the author should not\\nhave added notes to the work--the want of them will be seriously felt\\nby every one; some of the satires, indeed, must escape the reader,\\nunless he pay a degree of attention, which notes would have rendered\\nunnecessary. In his next edition, we trust that this deficiency may be\\nsupplied; and we anticipate as much instruction and entertainment,\\nfrom the wide scope which such an undertaking will afford, as we have\\nderived from the perusal of the text. Cheerfully would we extend to\\nhim, if required, the leisure claimed by Spenser, after he had\\ncomposed the first six books of his \"_Faerie Queene_,\" provided\\nhe would promise us similar conditions:--\\n\\n    \"After so long a race as I have run\\n      Through Faery Land, which those six books compile,\\n    Give leave to rest me, being half foredonne,\\n      And gather to myself new breath awhile;\\n\\n    \"Then, as a steed refreshed after toyle,\\n      Out of my prison will I break anew,\\n    And stoutly will that second work assoyle,\\n      With strong endeavour, and attention due.\"\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n[APPENDIX FOOTNOTES]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 1: Scott\\'s Swift, vol. xi. p. 4]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 2: Aristoph. in Pace. 130.]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 3: Orlando furioso, Canto xxxiv.

The choleric cook demanded of him to pay for his\\nbreakfast, the poor man denied having had any; and the controversy was\\nreferred to the deciding of the next man that should pass by, who\\nchanced to be the most notorious idiot in the whole city be, on the\\nrelation of the matter, determined that the poor man\\'s money should be\\nput betwixt two empty dishes, and the cook should be recompensed with\\nthe jingling of the poor man\\'s money, as he was satisfied with the\\nsmell of the cook\\'s meat.\"--_Fuller\\'s Holy State_, lib. iii. c.\\n12.]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 6: Aristophan. in pace. 137.]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 7: The idea of the Glonglims is the author\\'s. Ariosto makes\\nthe lost intellect, of those who become insane upon the earth, ascend\\nto the moon, where it is kept _bottled_.--\\n\\n    \"Era come un liquor suttile e molle,\\n    Atto a esalar, se non si tien ben chiuso;\\n    E si vedea raccolto in varie ampolle,\\n    Qual piu, qual men capace, atte a quell\\' uso.\"\\n\\n                  _Orlando furioso_, Cant. 34.

We present neither comedy, nor tragedy,\\nnor story, nor any thing, but that whosoever heareth may say this:--\\n\\'Why, here is a tale of the man in the moon.\\' Yet this is the man\\ndesignated by Blount, who re-published his plays in 1632, as the \\'_only\\nrare poet of that time, the witie, comicall, facetiously-quicke, and\\nunparallel\\'d John Lylie, Master of Arts!\\'\"]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 9: It is to be regretted that the author has not followed\\nthe good example set him by Johnson, in his _Debates in the Senate\\nof Magna Lilliputia_, published in the Gentlemen\\'s Magazine for\\n1738: the denominations of the speakers being formed of the letters of\\ntheir real names, so that they might be easily deciphered. This\\nneglect has obscured many of the author\\'s most interesting satires.\\nWho could suppose from the letters alone, that _Wigurd_, _Vindar_,\\nand _Avarabet_, were respectively intended for _Godwin_, _Darwin_,\\nand _Lavater_?]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 10: It is a curious circumstance, that Swift, in his\\ndescription of the Academy of Lagado, should have so completely\\nanticipated the Pestalozzian invention.]\\n\\n\\n[Footnote 11: Dryden\\'s Essay on Satire]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Voyage to the Moon, by George Tucker\\n\\n'"
