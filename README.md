To use the Gutenberg module, if you are located in Canada you need to change the Gutenberg mirror. The list of all available mirrors can be found at https://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL. 
This can be done in the terminal, using the following command: 
``` 
export GUTENBERG_MIRROR='http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/gutenberg/' 
```
